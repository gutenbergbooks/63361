<p class='c004'><b>The Spectator.</b>—“We have read Mrs. Steel’s book with ever-increasing
surprise and admiration—surprise at her insight into people with whom
she can scarcely have been intimate, admiration for the genius which has
enabled her to realize that wonderful welter of the East and West, which
Delhi must have presented just before the Mutiny. We know in literature
of few sketches better than those which reveal to us Buhadur Shah, the
last great Moghul ... or that of Zeemet Maihl, the evil Queen, ... or
of the Moulaire, who roused by his preaching the war against the English,
... or of Tiddu, the hereditary juggler-actor, ... or of Soma, the
haughty, sullen Sepoy. And the best evidence of Mrs. Steel’s genius is
that those who can scarcely conceive the society will feel certain that it is
truly drawn. There is many an officer who would give his sword to write
military history as Mrs. Steel has written the history of the rising, the siege,
and the storm. It is the most wonderful picture. We know that none who
lived through the Mutiny will lay the book down without a gasp of admiration,
and believe that the same emotion will be felt by thousands to whom
the scenes depicted are but lurid phantasmagoria.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—“All that relates to the natives, whether to the sepoys,
or the Court, or the town, is admirable; and the sketches of British
military and civil life are absolutely convincing. Mrs. Steel sees detail
everywhere, and records it minutely; but she is full of humanity, and can
give us the mysticism of the Oriental as faithfully as the easy-going morality
of the Anglo-Indian. Each incident, almost each chapter, is a picture by
itself, revealing an extraordinary wealth of descriptive power, and a masterly
insight into character.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>A.T.Q.C.</b> in <b>The Speaker</b>.—“It certainly is a remarkable book. The
native intrigues are brilliantly handled. Alice Gissing may claim to stand
beside the really great women of fiction. The whole book has the high
seriousness which, until quite recently, few people dreamed of as possible
in an Anglo-Indian novel.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—“Many novelists and spinners of tales have
made use of the Indian Mutiny, but Mrs. Steel leaves them all a long way
behind. Major Erlton and Alice Gissing challenge comparison with
Rawdon Crawley and Becky Sharp. ‘On the Face of the Waters’ is the
best novel of the Great Mutiny, and we are not likely to see its rival in our
time.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—“Of the familiar incidents of the early
Mutiny, how vivid and full of dramatic effect are the scenes as she paints
them! The tale has been often told, but never quite with Mrs. Steel’s
catholic sympathy with the native point of view. Her position is now
established as a writer of the truth and romance of India. She is a fine
writer, and she has written a fine novel about an epoch in our history which
Englishmen can never cease to weep over and to glory in.”</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Times.</b>—“Time was when these sketches of native Punjabi society
would have been considered a curiosity in literature. They are sufficiently
remarkable, even in these days, when interest in the ‘dumb millions’ of
India is thoroughly alive, and writers, great and small, vie in ministering
to it. Mrs. Steel has evidently been brought into close contact with the
domestic life of all classes, Hindu and Mahomedan, in city and village, and
has steeped herself in their customs and superstitions.... Mrs. Steel’s
book is of exceptional merit and freshness.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'><b>The Pall Mall Budget.</b>—“For this week the only novel worth mentioning
is Mrs. Steel’s ‘The Potter’s Thumb.’ Her admirable ‘From the Five
Rivers,’ since it dealt with native Indian life, was naturally compared with
Mr. Kipling’s stories. In ‘The Potter’s Thumb,’ the charm which came
from the freshness of them still remains. Almost every character is convincing,
and some of them excellent to a degree.”</p>

<p class='c004'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—“There is no one but Mr. Kipling who can make
his readers taste and smell, as well as see and hear, the East; and in this
book (if we except the description of Tarvin’s adventures in the deserted
city of Gunvaur, which is perhaps less clear-cut than usual) he has surely
surpassed himself. In his faculty for getting inside the Eastern mind and
showing its queer workings Mr. Kipling stands alone.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A dull red sun had just set amid purple
storm-clouds behind the Sussex Downs. Nevertheless
the twilight was falling softly beneath a wet
west wind that had made the land full of colour
and the sea full of shadow all day.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the stubble-field where the “hoppers”
 were lighting their camp-fires, one could just see
the sea through a dip in the land beneath the hill
where the old farm stood among the ash-trees.</p>

<p class='c001'>Against the privet hedge that hemmed the road,
a girl leaned with her back to the marsh-land that
spread westward from the hollow between the hills.
The half-picked hop-gardens were to right of her,
and, to left, the stubble-field where her comrades
were laughing and chattering around the water-budge
that had been drawn up in its midst. The
girl’s head lay black upon the sunset, but she was
not of a dark complexion—her hair was light
brown, and her skin was only tanned from exposure,
an exposure to which she had not, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>always been used, for the shape that showed
beneath her thin cotton dress was slenderer than
that of most field-workers.</p>

<p class='c001'>She stood there a moment watching the moving
groups yonder, and then passed out through the
gate on to the road. As she slammed it to behind
her, a tall young woman came swinging up a path
to the left, her black locks somewhat dishevelled
and her bodice loose at the throat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where are ye off to so glum, Jenny?”  said
she. “Come and ’ave a bit of a lark. ’Ere’s your
beau a-comin’ across the field.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl didn’t stop.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E ain’t no beau o’ mine, nor I don’t want him
to be,”  said she, and walked on quickly up the
road.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Lord no, o’ course not,”  called out the
other after her. “Ye don’t mind ’im lookin’ arter
ye all the ’opping-time, though! But I’m sure <i>I</i>
don’t want to take ’im from ye if ’e means business.
’E ain’t no beauty!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The man lounging across the stubble-field
stopped; he was still within ear-shot, as the girl
knew. Jenny faced round on her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll, please, not to say that again, Mary Ann
Mitcham,”  said she stiffly. “I’ve told ye Mr.
Martin ain’t no beau o’ mine, and that’s all about
it.”  And she strode on again beside the hedge.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other laughed as she swung herself over the
gate and ran off across the field; and she laughed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>again when she met the man and he gave her no
greeting, but passed her by with a sullen expression
on his face. She was used to calling that expression
on to folk’s faces, and rather enjoyed it than
otherwise. She called it up again on the face of a
slatternly woman who stood at the door of one of
the straw huts further on with a fretful baby in her
arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have ye seen Jenny anywheres, Mary Ann, my
dear?”  asked the woman. “I want ’er to come
and ’old this child a bit for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So as you may step up to the ‘Public’ for your
supper, eh, Mrs. Barnes,”  laughed the girl as she
ran. “Jenny’s always too good-natured, mindin’
yer squallin’ brats for ye. One’d think ye was ’er
mother instead of only a neighbour. But she’s
somethin’ better to do to-night: she’s a-courtin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’re a rude minx, and I don’t believe it,”
answered the woman tartly. “Why, Jenny never
’as no word to say for a man. And she’d nurse a
child all day and think it a treat. Ye can’t give
<i>Jenny’s</i> beau a name.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Can’t I then?”  sneered the girl. “It’s Mr.
Martin, that’s who her beau is!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman uttered an exclamation and stepped
outside.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’re dreamin’,”  she said. “He’s got somethin’
else to think of than foolin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye can see ’em for yerself,” scoffed Mary Ann,
pointing to the road where the heads of the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>and the girl were to be seen slowly passing along
above the privet hedge.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, <i>’e</i> ain’t much of a beau, then,”  sneered the
woman, “It’s disgustin’. A widower wi’ a child
to keep.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary Ann was hurrying on, but she turned
back.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What!” she shrieked. “Who says so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>"<i>I</i> says so," answered the woman. “Why, this
is his brat as I’ve got ’ere, so I ought to know it.
’E and his slip of a wife lived in my court up in
London, and when the mother died he guv me the
child to mind. But Lord, what ’e pays ain’t worth
the bother.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never!” exclaimed Mary Ann impressively.
“Do Jenny know it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” answered the woman, “and, look ’ere,
don’t ye go saying nothink about it neither. It’s
little enough, but sich as it is I can’t afford to lose
it, and he swore he’d take the brat away if ever I
said i’ the place as it were his’n.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary Ann laughed her resounding laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t want no chaff, I suppose?” roared she.
“I’ll think about it. If Jenny ain’t goin’ to ’ave
’im, there’s no call to tell. But Jenny’s my pal,
and I’ll not promise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If ye don’t I’ll scratch ye,” screamed the woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Miss Mitcham had eluded her and escaped
to the group beside the water-budge, where there
was more fun.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Meanwhile the man, shuffling in the dust, had
caught up Jenny on the road. He had a slow,
weary sort of gait, and was evidently not of the
soil any more than the rest. In their different
ways they all had an air of city slums about them
in spite of their tanned faces and hands torn by
ragged bines and rough hop-poles.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are ye goin’ to buy for supper to-night?”
said he, after they had tramped along a little way
without a word. “The bacon ain’t p’tickler good
in this ’ere village, are it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He had a slow speech, but not unmusical, and
the expression of his face, though of the contemplative
order, was frank and friendly, and suggested
none of the discontent that his words might have
implied.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” answered she. “But I ain’t goin’ to buy
no supper to-night. I’ll get a drink o’ milk from
the farm presently. I ain’t ’ungry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye can’t work if ye don’t eat,” said he, and
then added shyly: “’Aven’t ye got no money?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She flushed a quick red, and he hastened to say
apologetically: “Girls are apt to send it all ’ome,
I know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ain’t got no ’ome,” said she shortly, “nor yet
any one as wants my money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What,” said he, “’aven’t you got no father nor
mother?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” she answered; “I ’aven’t, and I don’t
know as you’ve any call to ask.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>“Beg pardon,” said the man, and then he began
to whistle, and looked away awkwardly. “I filled
a can o’ water for ye at the budge,” said he presently.
“It’s by yer door.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you,” said she. And then there was
silence again.</p>

<p class='c001'>They walked on thus another couple of hundred
yards down the road, and then turned aside beyond
the hop-fields up a steep and shady lane that was
dark in the dusky light. Half way up there was a
break in the trees on one side through which one
could see the evening sky beyond the Scotch firs.
Here Martin suddenly stopped and came close up
to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Miss,” said he, without any introduction, “I’ve
noticed as ye’re short wi’ me to-night, and I’ve
been thinkin’ as p’r’aps ye’ve cause.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked at him now; she had eyes like a
startled fawn’s—now brown, now grey.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I <i>ain’t</i> been,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” insisted he, “and ye’ve cause. I’ve been
courtin’ ye all the ’oppin’, and we don’t get on—and
folk talk and vex ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He paused a moment, but she only hung her
head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But we’ll make it right now, if so be as ye’re
willin’,” said he. And still as she said nothing, he
came closer, and tried to put his arm round her
waist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she sprang back, her eyes more than ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>startled. She was slender, but she was strong, and
she gave him such a thud in the chest as sent him
reeling against the bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Keep your distance, if you please,” panted she.
“I don’t want none o’ that. Ye’ve been hearin’
tales o’ me, and ye’ve thought ... but—well, there
ye’re mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He picked up his cap, which had fallen off, and
stood with it in his hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know what ye mean,” he said, a trifle
sullenly. “I ain’t ’eard no tales of ye. But I’m
sorry I angered ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ain’t angry,” said she, and she spoke impassively,
her sudden fire quenched as it was born.
“Only I don’t want no courtin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t think ye understand me,” said he, more
softly. “I mean honourable by ye. I want ye to
stand up afore the parson wi’ me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She gave a start, but she did not look at him,
nor did she utter a word. Behind her head in the
gap of the trees the huge arms of the windmill
made a black cross on the luminous sky where
the reflections of the afterglow were fading into a
steely blue.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want to git married,” said she at last,
without lifting her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked at her in doubt. Then he said as
though with a sudden thought:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s <i>you</i> that’s ’eard tales o’ <i>me</i>, I’m thinkin’!
But I’m comin’ to that. I’ve been wed afore, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>I’ve a brat—a boy. But I ’oped ye wouldn’t let
that stand in my way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She had looked up for a moment, but had as
quickly looked away again, and, after waiting a
little, he went on:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You said just now you’d no ’ome. It ain’t
comfortable for a young maid to ’ave no ’ome, and
I’d work to give ye as good a one as most.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want no ’ome,” said she at last, sullenly.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sighed a little. “It’s the brat ye’re afeard
on,” murmured he sadly, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No it <i>ain’t</i> then,” cried she quickly, almost
fiercely. “I could love a brat well enough.” She
stopped short, and if he could have distinguished
her face in the dark he would have seen it flush
hot and red. But he could not, and she moved
away from him—moved away, but came back
again. “There,” she said half surlily, “ye’ve got
to know, and I’d as lief tell ye myself. I’ve ’ad a
brat o’ my own,” and she looked away quickly.</p>

<p class='c001'>For a moment he did not answer, then he seized
her wrist roughly. “What, you’re married then?”
he muttered. “Well, ’pon my word, I think ye
might ha’ told a man when ye see’d as ’e were
sweet on ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She snatched her hand away. “I’m <i>not</i> married,”
she cried roughly.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was silence, but as he did not speak, she
had to go on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think ye might make shift to see,” said she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>angrily. “O’ course a girl don’t want to go a-talkin’
of it.” She caught her breath, but added quickly
in the same tone as before: “For ye could ha’
knowed I shouldn’t be such a cheat as not to tell—when
ye was goin’ to be’ave honourable to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He stood there full half a minute, gazing at her
as one dazed. Then he muttered: “How was I
to guess?” and dropped his eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>He could hear her breathing hard, but she said
no more, and after a while he asked suddenly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where is ’e? ’Ave ’e deserted ye—the sc——”</p>

<p class='c001'>She interrupted him. “’E’s dead,” she said
quickly. And then she added, half whimpering:
“’E said ’e would ha’ wed me, and p’r’aps ’e would.
Anyways it’s too late now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And the brat?” asked he in a dull voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>She moved her head restlessly, looking out to
the rosy west. Then dropping her voice to a
whisper, she murmured softly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s dead too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was awed involuntarily and answered nothing.
He did not even dare look at her face, but he could
see by the rise and fall of her shoulders that she
was crying.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Them as know I bore ’im,” she continued
presently in an excited way, “they say as I ought
to thank my stars ’e’s dead and buried and can’t
tell no tales. That’s all <i>they</i> knows about it. They
didn’t never lose a child, them folk didn’t! What
if ’e ’ad ha’ told tales o’ my shame? I’d ha’ put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>up with that, and willing, so as I’d ’ad ’im to work
for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She choked down a sob, and wiped her eyes with
the hem of her skirt.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m sorry for ye, I’m sure,” said he drearily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, ’e <i>were</i> a pretty babe, Mr. Martin,” continued
she, forgetful for the moment of all but the
memories that this seeming touch of sympathy
had awakened, and she turned to him with sweet
and simple confidence. “Just the prettiest ye
ever seed! He might ha’ been a lady’s, so white
he were! I done all I could to save ’im, but it
weren’t a bit o’ use. And I ’eld ’im in my arms
hours and hours arter ’e was dead—’cos I couldn’t
believe it, ye see. But I couldn’t put my breath
into ’im, though I’d ha’ done it if I could—Lord,
I’d ha’ done it willin’!” She drew in her breath
with a quick gasp, and added hoarsely: “It do
seem ’ard, don’t it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, it <i>do</i> seem precious ’ard,” he repeated, but
without looking at her, and his voice as he said it
was hard as iron.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a moment her whole attitude changed. She
drew herself up, as though turned to stone, and
looked at him quickly. The light was growing
so dim in the lane that she could not see his face.
But there was no need; the voice told plainly
enough what the face was like, and immediately
her tears were quenched, and the softness in her
shrank away, as from a cruel gaze.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The afterglow was almost spent in the west,
leaving only a warmer tone upon the marsh and
a more metallic light upon the stream that crossed
it; the moon, having risen out of the sea, was just
level with the eastern down, and the pine-stems
upon its ridge crossed the white disc darkly.
Solitary figures coming from the mill on the hill’s
crest, strayed across the brown slope beneath them,
and a group of men and women returning to the
camp sang snatches of song as they lounged along
the road in the hollow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jenny shook herself as she heard them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good-night,” she said curtly. “I expec’ ye
ain’t got nothing more to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I don’t know as I ’ave,” murmured he
slowly.</p>

<p class='c001'>But almost before the words were out of his
mouth, Jenny was far below him on the steep lane,
running as though for her life. He stood there,
still with his cap in his hand; there was a lump in
his throat, and he swore a quiet oath to himself as
he watched her flit through the twilight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fires of the “foreigners,” that had burnt so
gaily in the hollow, had all fallen to embers; the
moon rode across an inky blue sky where the afterglow
had so late been warm; the camp was dead
silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>Martin rose from the straw within his hut and
came out into the night, for he was restless and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>could not sleep. He stood outside trying to take
comfort in a pipe, and looking up at the eastern
sky where the windmill still made the huge black
cross on the blue. The stars were coming out, but
the moon’s light was fitful and the marsh-land
beyond the hop-fields was gloomy save where the
stream was touched now and then into the brightness
of a glistening snake. A little dyke divided
the stubble-field from the meadow beyond it, where
a white horse strayed in the dusk. Martin thought
he heard the wailing of an infant, and then the dull
crooning of a woman’s singing come from among
the willows, and then he saw a girl’s figure pacing
up and down with a little bundle in her arms.
Presently the girl crossed over to the last hut in
the camp, which he knew to be Jenny’s, deposited
the bundle within, came out again, and, stretching
her tired arms above her head, stood leaning a
moment against the straw.</p>

<p class='c001'>He felt his heart stir; what did it mean? And
he crossed the field at once that he might know.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet he was not sure that he wanted to speak to
her, and it struck him that the sound of his footsteps
crushing the stubble would arouse her. But
she stood neither seeing nor hearing, with her eyes
fixed on the sombre marsh-land yonder till a
woman’s voice sounded in thick accents calling
down the field.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jenny,” it said, “Jenny, girl, where ’ve ye got to?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she started, and placed herself quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>before the door of the hut, and he as quickly withdrew
behind it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman shuffled over the stubble, catching
her feet in it, and reeling slightly as she walked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Give me the child,” said she indistinctly when
she got close to the girl. “I dursen’t let ye ’ave it
no longer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Martin started now, for he saw that the woman
was Mrs. Barnes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“<i>Dursen’t</i>,” repeated Jenny savagely! “Ain’t I
fitter to mind a child than you? Yes—though
you be his mother! A nice state ye’re in to-night
to mind a sick brat!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ain’t in no state at all,” grumbled the woman
feebly. “Give me the child, I tell ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I sha’n’t,” answered Jenny, “so there! I’ve
’ad job enough wi’ the poor mite, and he’s sleepin’
peaceful now. I ain’t a-goin’ to let you throw him
back in convulsions; no, not if ye was twenty times
’is mother! Ye ain’t fit to ’ave ’im to-night, I tell
ye. I’ll bring ’im in the mornin’!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Lord, twenty times ’is mother,” echoed
Mrs. Barnes, beginning to laugh foolishly and as
quickly changing the laugh to a whimper!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get ye’ gone, do,” said the girl, “ye’ll wake ’im
again! I tell ye, ye shall ’ave yer child in the
mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She went within, and the woman, unable to cope
with any resistance, shambled feebly off again,
laughing and crying as she went.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Martin stepped forward out of the shadow, shaking
his fist at her. Inside the hut he could see
Jenny on her knees beside a bundle of shawls, on
which she had laid the little one,—Jenny, tenderly
arranging ragged coverings more closely round a
tiny body. Yes—Jenny on her knees beside his
own child, stroking it softly, singing pretty ditties
to it in an undertone, cherishing it with every
sweet sound that bubbles to a mother’s lips: her
own was gone, but she had learnt the trick
of child-love that slumbers in every woman’s
breast, and this strange and lonely babe was
soothing her sore heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>Martin stood watching her, motionless, not daring
to breathe. But there was something in his throat
that troubled him, and he lifted his hand to his
eyes, and in so doing rustled the straw of the hut
against which he stood.</p>

<p class='c001'>She started.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who’s that?” she cried, jumping up.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he advanced slowly into the opening.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s me,” he said humbly.</p>

<p class='c001'>She motioned to him to go further off, and then
she followed him outside until they both stood in
the full moonlight. She was trembling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye ’adn’t no call to come round ’ere at this
time o’ night,” said she in her old defiant tone—but
her voice was low, for, stirred as she was, she
still remembered the sleeping babe.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor I didn’t mean to,” said he, nowise offended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and still apologetic. “But I see’d ye hushin’ the
brat, and I wondered what was up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s Mrs. Barnes’s brat,” said she, a trifle coldly.
“It’s sick, and I’m mindin’ it for ’er. She ain’t fit
to ’ave a child of ’er own.” She said it almost
roughly, and then lapsed into silence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Martin sighed, and stood considering.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It ain’t Mrs. Barnes’s brat,” said he at last.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked at him quickly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It ain’t Mrs. Barnes’s?” repeated she, puzzled.
“Why, o’ course it is! I fetched it to-night.” Then
a quick suspicion of <i>his</i> possible suspicion crossing
her mind she said, in a voice in which shame and
anger strangely wrestled: “Who’s do <i>you</i> think
it is?”</p>

<p class='c001'>But he had no glimmering of her thought, and
said in the same humble tone as before:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ye see, I <i>know</i> who’s ’tis—’cos it’s mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She turned sharply, staring at him open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I never!” she ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said he in the same awkward way, “that
’ere’s my boy that I told ye of. Mrs. Barnes ’as
’ad the mindin’ of ’im—and I never knowed till
now what sort o’ mindin’ it was—but that ’ere’s my
boy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who’d ha’ thought ’e was such a little ’un?”
murmured Jenny dreamily—“just as big as mine
were.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, ’e ain’t very old yet,” allowed the man,
“only a year come Lord Mayor’s Day, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>mother died as ’e were born. She was but sickly,
and ’e ain’t much. Not but what ’e might ha’ been
better, but, Lord, a man don’t know ’ow a child
have got to be minded, bless ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The old defiance that had flashed back into
Jenny’s face a minute ago had faded away again,
and she was pale in the wan light.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course not,” she said commiseratingly, and
yet with a quiet air of superiority.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, <i>you</i> know,” said he, with honest admiration.
“But, there, I don’t suppose ye’d give a thought
to such a thing as mindin’ of <i>’im</i>?” he murmured
sheepishly. He had lifted his eyes to her, but he
drew them away again—while he waited.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve got my living to work for,” said she. “I
shouldn’t ’ave time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he took heart of grace—he came close to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if there was some one to work for you,”
said he. “If we was wed, so to speak?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She didn’t move, but her eyes grew startled, and
then just a touch of hardness came back into her
face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t say that up yonder,” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” he said, “I’ll allow I was startled a bit at
first. But ... well, I know as you’re a good woman
somehow ... and I love ye, Jenny—there! So if
you can forget, well, so can I.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She stood, with her lips parted, gazing straight
out across the field—but a film of tears gathered
slowly across her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Neither spoke, and the minutes sped by as in a
dream, while the stars rained down their tenderness.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as she stood there with that sweet seriousness
of thought on her simple face, the babe,
missing its lullaby, sent forth a piteous wail from
within.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she sprang to its side, and snatching it to
her breast and bending o’er it a face, tender as the
moonlight that bathed her, she whispered softly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll think on it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A man and a woman stood in a country lane
as the sun was setting. It was where the lane
broke out into the open ground of the common,
and above them on the hill a windmill was swinging
gaunt, lazy arms against the sky. On one
side it looked down and across the marsh to the
incoming tide, and on the other it commanded
miles of pasture-land and hop-fields, and saw the
Sussex Downs roll away beyond: behind it, on
a sky of opaque blue, the moon had just risen red,
and looked at the setting sun opposite. The man
stood ruefully, gazing up at the mill, his back half
turned to the woman, who was talking fast and
loud.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were hop-pickers; not of those out of
city slums, but of the tidier and better class who
come from distant villages for the sake of the
change and airing; there had been a gang of
them, and they were all to be sent home on the
morrow.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“But o’ course it’s enough for me to say I want
a thing for you to gainsay me,” the woman was
saying. She was a tall, dark, powerful young
person, and the man, with his slouching gait and
thin, sallow face, was evidently immeasurably her
inferior in physical strength, and had a meek, deprecating
manner that made her words seem
somewhat of a mockery.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m sure I don’t want for to gainsay ye,
Martha,” he replied humbly. “But I don’t see
why ye can’t go up to the mill and see Mrs. Moss
without me coming too. Ole friends is ole friends,
o’ course, and ’tis nat’ral comin’ back to th’ ole
place—we should want to see ’em. But there’s
reasons for things, and reasons agin ’em, so to
speak. You and Milly Harkitt was none such
friends when ye lived ’ere afore ye was wed—if
the sayin’s true.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Martha laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sayin’s ain’t never true,” she said bluntly.
“Else there’s a sayin’ as you and she was friends
if we wasn’t! Reasons for and reasons agin,
indeed! Milly’s wed since I see ’er, and I want
to ’ave a look and see if it’s altered ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The man blushed and smiled, but he neither
retorted nor denied the charge.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She were a pritty gentle crittur,” was all he
said, thoughtfully looking beyond his wife. “I
’ope she bain’t altered.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman looked at him sharply.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Well, if ye want so much to know, ye’d best
come and see,” she said tartly.</p>

<p class='c001'>He brought his slow gaze back to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that all ye be goin’ up there for?” said he
irrelevantly, and one might have said, suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never you mind what I’m goin’ for,” retorted
she, stepping out up the hill. “I be goin’ to please
myself, and that’s enough. I’ll be ’ome to supper,
and mind you don’t go fallin’ in with no pals as
you did last night, and come ’ome late. I don’t
know but what you ’adn’t best step up and fetch
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All right,” said the man as he turned away
down the lane. “What time?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eight o’clock,” she called back promptly.
“And you know I don’t relish waiting.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I won’t keep ye waitin’,” said he quietly. “I’ll
stop outside for ye at eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, afraid to have a look at the girl!”
laughed she again. And she went on smartly up
the hill. But when she got to the top she did not
at once turn into the garden that surrounded the
house, but stood awhile in the field, leaning her
arms on the gate and staring out to the sunset.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was not of the dreamy sort, but to-night
she was thinking: thinking a little bit of the man
who had just left her—trying to remember just
how much she had heard about him and Milly,
but thinking more still of another young man who
had many times stood at her side in yonder lane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>or at this very gate whence she now watched the
afterglow gild the purple cloud-banks out west.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had thought that she had loved the latter,
and there could be no doubt that he was younger
and richer and comelier than the man whom she
had married, and he had bent tender eyes on her
such as a girl loves. But there had come a little
rift between them, and when she had been obliged
to leave the village and go to keep house for an
uncle some distance off, the rift had widened, and
then she had heard that he had married another.
That other was the very girl she had come to see
to-night, and she was just wondering whether she
would like to meet the man or no.</p>

<p class='c001'>But as she was secretly determining on the exact
measure of scorn she would throw into her manner,
and wondering if her beauty was in any way
dimmed since he had seen her, fate decided for
her, for the door of the mill-house opened, and she
heard his voice on the threshold.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, leave that whimperin’, Milly, do,” said
the voice sharply, but not unkindly. “I never see
sich a gal! Ye be allers low-spirited now-a-days.
Why can’t ye be cheerful a-nussin’ o’ the baby, and
let a man go ’bout ’is business?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Dan, I don’t want ye to go to the ‘Public’
to-night,” said the woman within, and there was
no doubt that the tone did lay itself open to the
accusation of a whimper. “Ye come ’ome so late
last night, and I bain’t strong yet, ye know. I’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>been alone all day—I don’t want ye to go out
agin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Late! Lor’ bless me, it weren’t gone ten
o’clock!” retorted the man. “You’d want a ’usbin’
allers ’oppin’ around ye! I bain’t that sort! When
be ye goin’ to pluck up and show a feller a jolly
face, and get about yer work agin—eh?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’re niver goin’ to throw it up agin me as I
bain’t strong, and baby not six weeks old,” began
the woman, the whimper bidding ominously fair
to swell to greater volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Martha heard a rough, quick, jovial expostulation,
and then a big, loud kiss; the
whimpering grew softer, and a moment after the
door slammed to, and she saw a man come striding
towards her down the garden-walk in the dusk.
At first she had a silly desire to run, but a moment
after she laughed at the very thought, and felt
that she really didn’t care. So she walked straight
up to the garden-gate, and put her hand on the
latch at the very same instant as the man reached
it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What be your business, ma’am, please?” he
began, then quickly changing his tone added:
“Why I’m blowed if it ain’t Martha Bond!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The young woman laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, no, ’tain’t!” said she. “It’s Martha Hewson.
I be married, same as you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I’m pleased to ’ear it, I’m sure,” said the
man, without being in the least ruffled, “and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>ill-will bore, I can see, which there bain’t no cause,
o’ course.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course not,” agreed she. “Ill-will, indeed!
I should like to know what for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Least said, soonest mended, I s’pose,” assented
the man with a jolly laugh. “And where might
you be livin’ now-a-days?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Up to Wycombe,” answered she. “Me and
my ’usbin’ come over ’ere to do a bit o’ hop-pickin’.
’E bain’t over-strong, and I thought it ’ud do ’im
good. We be off to-morrer, and I thought I’d just
step up and see yer wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She’ll take it very kindly, I’m sure,” said the
man doubtfully, but rather glad to be rid of this
visitor at any cost. “She bain’t very well—she
bain’t never strong same as other women,” he
added. “You might put a bit o’ spunk into ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he led the way up the garden-walk.</p>

<p class='c001'>Martha was half offended. She was not sure she
had come to put spunk into her old sweetheart’s
wife—and surely Dan Moss was very dull to what
he used to be! She felt still more sorry she had
come when she saw the awkward shyness of the
little woman whom they disturbed nursing her
babe at the fireside.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ere be Mrs. Hewson, Martha Bond as was, come
to see you,” said the husband, and added hurriedly
to the visitor: “There, Milly ’ll get ye a cup o’
tea, ma’am, and you two ’ll ’ave a good bit of a
gossip whiles I steps down to the village. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>just a-sayin’ she were a bit lonesome. Good-night
to ye, and pleased to see ye look so ’earty.” And
he bustled out as quickly as he had bustled in.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must excuse ’im,” said the young mother,
blushing for her man, while she stilled the cries of
the injured babe interrupted at his meal. “Dan’s
allers in a ’urry to be off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May be ’e ’ave got business,” said Martha, civilly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, no, ’e ain’t,” said the wife. “But Dan bain’t
niver been a stay-at-’ome man. ’Is mother were
a rough customer they do say, and she didn’t use
’im to it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, and <i>I’ve</i> ’eard tell she were too much sot
on ’im altogether,” laughed Martha. “Wouldn’t
let ’im go out for ’alf a’ ’our’s chat but what she’d
call ’is dead father to mind when ’e come ’ome, and
snivel over ’im as if ’e was a child. A man couldn’t
be expected to stan’ that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“P’r’aps not,” assented the other, considering.
“All the same it bain’t much use ’avin’ a man if
’e bain’t niver at ’ome. Maybe your ’usbin’ don’t
care for company.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d catch im carin’ for any company but mine
when I wanted his’n,” declared Mrs. Hewson
defiantly. “But I bain’t one to care for a man
allers draggin’ about—they be more in the way
than hanythink. I can’t niver find two words to
say to Bill when once I’ve giv’ ’im ’is cup o’ tea or
whativer it might be. It be more nor I can make
out ’ow women can bide men plaguin’ round ’em
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>from mornin’ till night. Bill be too stay-at-’ome
by ’alf—though, to be sure, I do let ’im ’ave it if
’e come ’ome late o’ nights, that be certain,” she
added, laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other woman stared at her a minute, speechless
and wondering; then she sighed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I niver!” ejaculated she. “Pore feller!”
and the thought flew through her mind that she
would not have treated him so.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pore feller indeed!” cried Mrs. Hewson indignantly.
“Why, bain’t ’e dead sot on me, and
wouldn’t ’e rayther ’ave my tongue any day than
another gal’s palavers? What else should ’e be so
stay-at-’ome for, I’d like to know? Pore feller!
What next?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She settled her hat on her head with a quick,
irritated movement, but the next minute she
laughed again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But belike you fancy a man allers a-dancin’
round you,” laughed she. “Some gals do. I can
swop a buss now and then as well as most, but I
like to get it over o’ proper times.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Milly blushed, and shifted the baby to the other
arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought as iverybody liked their man to get
time to admire ’em a bit,” said she shyly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is that what ye be after?” laughed Martha.
“Lord, I wouldn’t give much for Bill’s taste. ’E
don’t know black from blue.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E ’ave ’ad the taste ye wanted ’im to ’ave, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>s’pose,” retorted the little woman—“’e ’ave ’ad the
taste to fancy you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her delicate face flushed, and there was just a
tinge of spite in her tone, for could she not remember
the day when Mr. Hewson’s taste had not
been for dark, powerful girls?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, yes, ’e ’ave ’ad <i>that</i>,” assented the other in
an off-hand way. "He knowed I were the only
one as could ha’ made hanythink of ’im. If ’e ’ad
ha’ married a pore gumptionless soul like some"—and
Martha looked out of the corner of the eye at
her hostess—“’e wouldn’t ha’ been nowhere! ’E
needs a good strong, smart gal, ’e do, pore soul!
Ye wouldn’t b’lieve the time I be seein’ <a id='corr31.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='to’ im'>to ’im</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_31.14'><ins class='correction' title='to’ im'>to ’im</ins></a></span>—as
good as gold, but a pore shiftless crittur! If it
weren’t for me, we wouldn’t ’ave bite nor sup to
put in our mouths. I be forced to put spunk into
<i>’im</i> same time as I work for the lot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wouldn’t ha’ believed it,” said Milly Moss,
rocking the child.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, you may then,” declared Martha emphatically.
“It be a good job I ain’t got no little ’un
yet, for I’d ’ave two to see to then. You be to be
envied, you be, with a great, fine, strappin’ feller
for a ’usbin’ what knows ’is own mind, and....”</p>

<p class='c001'>And Martha stopped abruptly, for it had crossed
her memory that she had once upbraided Dan
Moss in her heart for <i>not</i> knowing his own mind,
and a quick dart of vexation ran through her because,
in the heat of the hour, she had both praised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the man who had not followed up his attentions to
her, and run down the man who had.</p>

<p class='c001'>She bit her lip and thought how she could repair
her error, but her turn for speech was gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You do surprise me,” said the envied woman,
opening a pair of pale blue eyes very wide. “And
I was jist a-thinkin’ what a lucky body you was to
’ave a man as stayed at ’ome and looked arter ye.
For ye can’t think ’ow lonesome I am o’ times!
Dan ’e be such a favourite-like i’ the village. Somebody’s
allers askin’ ’im to go along wi’ ’em drinkin’
or spreein’ one way or another. O’ course I know
’e be rare and clever. ’E wouldn’t make the mill
pay as it do if ’e wasn’t. And I don’t grumble so
long as it’s work as takes im out—but I do think
it’s a shame not never to get a look-in at your own
man till it’s time to go to sleep-like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Moss took out her handkerchief and wiped
her eyes furtively, but the baby waking at this
interruption, she was forced to give all her mind to
hushing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Hewson sat pondering.</p>

<p class='c001'>She remembered that she had once thought that
life with Dan Moss would be rather a jolly affair,
but if his jollity was always kept for out-of-doors,
it wasn’t all beer and skittles after all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye treat ’im too meek-like,” said she after a
minute. “I wouldn’t mind so much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ow can ye ’elp mindin’ when ye’ve married a
man?” retorted the other.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Well, I’d be cheerfuller—I’d pay ’im back a bit
in ’is own coin, I be blowed if I wouldn’t,” laughed
Martha.</p>

<p class='c001'>Milly shook her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dan ain’t one to stand no nonsense,” said she.
“I tried it on a bit when we was fust wed, and
blessed if ’e didn’t up and off it for a week! Didn’t
say nothink, mind you, but jist up and off it. Said
it were business, but o’ course <i>that</i> wasn’t what I
wanted!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lor’ bless me!” ejaculated the other. “Well,
I be pleased my Bill don’t give me no tantrums.
We ain’t ’ad a word ever since we was wed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, well, who said we had words? Everybody
’as their faults. We don’t ’ave no <i>words</i>,” retorted
the miller’s wife, tossing her head a bit proudly.
And she got up and began busying herself over the
tea.</p>

<p class='c001'>She too was a little sorry she had let herself be
betrayed into these confidences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile outside, the moon had climbed the
first steeps of the horizon, and had put out the last
fires of the sunset; the merest memory of gold was
left floating on the western clouds and yellowing
the streak of clear sky above the solemn, purple
downs; but in the blue overhead the moon had
sway, and hung silver on the gently swaying
plumes of the pines upon the hills hard by.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bill Hewson was climbing the hill in obedience
to the promise given to his wife an hour before.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>But he was not alone; he had met Moss on the
village green down yonder by the “Public,” and
Moss, in his genial way, had accosted him to wish
him joy of his marriage, and so it had come to pass
that the two—never more than the merest acquaintances
when both lived in the village—had fallen
into intimate converse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hewson was panting a bit as he kept pace up
the road beside his great, long-limbed companion,
for the air was coming briskly from the west, and
the first frosts were falling at night, and he was
asthmatic.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t ought to be out o’ nights now it’s
turned so sharp,” said his companion kindly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A man can’t afford to think o’ such things,”
said Hewson.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, leastways when there bain’t no need,”
allowed the miller. “And ye didn’t so much as
put a drop inside ye at the bar to warm ye up for
the job.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I scarce ever touches sperrits,” said Hewson
quietly. “Martha, she don’t think it’s right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller stopped short in the road and stared
at his comrade; but they were in a wood now, and
he couldn’t see his face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Martha, be——” he began. But he dropped a
brown-paper parcel that he was carrying and he
turned the phrase into: “Drat the thing——” as he
stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, Martha don’t think it’s right, nor she don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>think it’s ’olesome neither,” repeated the feebler
man slowly,</p>

<p class='c001'>Moss laughed long and loudly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I be blessed if I’d go blowin’ up this ’ill
as you be a-doin’ then,” said he at last. “No, not
to fetch any woman under the sun, if she wouldn’t
allow me a swaller first to put the ’eart into my
stomach, so to speak! Ye be too easy, mate. Bain’t
she well and ’earty and fit to look arter ’erself?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, she be well and ’earty enough,” allowed the
husband. “I don’t know as I iver see’d a ’eartier
gal. But ... well, ye see, Martha don’t think
small beer of ’erself, and she <i>be</i> a fine woman,
ye’ll allow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, she be a fine woman and no mistake,”
allowed the miller, smiling to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I often wonders what it was made ’er take to
the likes o’ me,” went on the other, “for I bain’t no
catch. And I allers feels I ought to make it up to
’er, so to speak. But I don’t deny it do come a bit
’ard o’ times.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A bit of a Tartar, eh?” asked Moss confidentially.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I won’t go so far as to say that,” replied the
henpecked one as who should refuse to admit a
thing that he feared might be true. “She be a just
woman, she be, but she bain’t just what ye might
call a gentle un’. I’ve sometimes thought as she
be too clever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah. I don’t know as I care for ’em so clever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>as all that,” said the miller. “I shouldn’t like a
wife cleverer nor myself, now. But there be them
as gives up, like, every minute, and that bain’t all
fun neither. Why, Lor’ bless me, there be some
women want ye to be at their elber to ’elp ’em tell
whether the milk be sour or no. It be real contrairy
o’ times. Ye be forced to go out-doors to get a
minute’s peace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, talk at ye twenty to the dozen?” asked
Hewson feelingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not so much talk as whine at ye! Make ye
believe ye’re a downright brute afore they’ve done.
Till ye be forced to go and get a glass o’ beer
into ye to see things straight agin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Talkin’ be wuss,” said Hewson simply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, ye ’aven’t tried whinin’,” retorted Moss.
“You wait till you ’ave!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I bain’t likely to,” answered the other in a
matter-of-fact way. “Martha she bain’t given that
way. And I be glad of it, now I hear what you
say. I did think—but, there, that’s neither here
nor there. I don’t mind sayin’ I’ve altered my
mind since I’ve ’eard what you say. I likes ’em
gentle, but I likes ’em spry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t believe ye can ’ave it both ways,” he
said, with a great air of wisdom. “They ’as their
feelin’s when they’s soft-like, and feelin’s is a darned
noosance. Ye don’t get no dinner when feelin’s is
on the go.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“I wouldn’t stomach that,” declared Hewson,
shaking his head. “The smart ones they do look
arter ye well, if they <i>don’t</i> let ye call yer soul yer
own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Blowed if I’d put up wi’ not bein’ master
under my own roof, though,” declared the miller
emphatically. “I’d rather find the kitchen fire out,
by a long way, than ’ave my words snapped up
when I be settin’ aside it. I can’t abide temper
in a woman nor more nor in a ’oss!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All the same a bit o’ warm fire and a cosy ’ome
do come in comfortable when a man be feelin’ a
bit rocky,” urged Hewson more decisively than
usual. “No dinner—that be bad! I feel sorry for
ye, neighbour, I do indeed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller stood still and stared a minute, and
then he broke into his loud, resonant laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, ye bain’t no call to be sorry for me,” he said
cheerily. “I be gettin’ on fust-rate, thank ye,” and
he shifted the brown-paper parcel from one arm to
the other. “We was but passin’ opinions on the
breeds and pedigrees o’ the women-folk, as far as
I be aware. Why, I’d rather ’ave all the pumps
on at once than see the ricks a-burnin’ for ten
minutes. Each man to ’is taste, neighbour, and
thank <i>you</i> for a ’alf hour’s exchange ’o notions, so
to speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Hewson smiled, a trifle bewildered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That be it,” said he genially. “Each man to ’is
taste, or in other words—let every one put up wi’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>what ’e ’ave got. A blemish is a blemish, but the
mare may be sound for all that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sound!” began the miller, half angrily. But he
had reached the top of the hill; his own garden-gate
was in sight, and his own house-door opened
and sent a flood of yellow light down the walk to
put out the white moonbeams on the hollyhocks
and the sunflowers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Right ye be, man,” cried he good-humouredly,
slapping his comrade noisily on the back. “We
won’t fight over ’em; there’s blemishes, I dare say,
but the mares be both sound for all that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And on the doorstep the women were exchanging
a last word.</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller’s wife, warmed to further unbosoming
by a seductive cup of tea, was pouring final
confidences into Mrs. Hewson’s willing ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you’d believe it,” she was saying shyly,
“there were a time when I were nigh to fancyin’
Mr. Hewson myself. Not that there iver were much
atween us, and I don’t know as I could say ’e iver
come nigh to askin’ me. But ’e were that kind and
gentle, I thought as ’e’d make a nice, considerin’
’usbin’, and I thought I could ha’ got him if I’d
tried. But, Lor’, now I know ’e’ve so little sperrit,
I don’t think as it’d ha’ suited at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, don’t ye!” retorted Martha, with a good
dash of honest viciousness in her tones which
the other was too dense or too pre-occupied to
notice.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“I ain’t got your ’ealth nor yet your managin’
ways, ye see,” Milly was murmuring on softly.
“Not but what I do pity you, my dear....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, then, ye needn’t to do no such thing,”
interrupted Mrs. Hewson sharply. “My man may
be a bit soft o’ times—though ’ow you come to
fancy it, I be sure I don’t know—but ’e don’t come
masterin’ it over a body, nor yet ’e don’t spend his
evenin’s at the ‘Public,’ and leave ’is wife alone at
the fire-side. If I was a chatterbox I might ’ave a
word to say ’bout bygones too! But, Lor’ bless
me, I niver was one to boast! Nor yet to ’anker
after showin’ up as I was once nigh upon makin’
a fool o’ myself!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Martha laughed a rough laugh, and the ready
eyes of the miller’s wife filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My word, I don’t know what ye mean!” faltered
she with quivering voice. “But if anybody says as
my Dan neglects ’is wife....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there, least said soonest mended,” put in
Martha Hewson hurriedly, for she had seen two
dark forms coming up the hill in the moonlight.
Her temper had been “up” at the slight which the
other, in her foolishness, had dealt to her “man”;
and she had not the smallest intention of hearing
him made light of, however much she might grind
him down herself. But being a good-natured soul
at bottom, and not anxious moreover to give herself
away, she was not going to have this silly conversation
overheard.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“I don’t know as it is,” began the foolish little
woman, swallowing her tears. “I shall tell Dan
what ye said, and....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If ye do ye’ll ’ave to tell ’im who ’t were said
he went to the ‘Public’ every night,” laughed
Martha, jeering. But she added quickly: “There,
ye mustn’t mind me. I’ve a rough tongue, but
I don’t mean no ’arm. We’ve both on us ’ad a
gossip and talked a bit o’ nonsense, but there bain’t
no bones broke arter all. You dry yer eyes and
show your ’usbin’ a jolly face. Look, ere ’e be!
I must be gone. I be late as ’tis. We’s off
to-morrer, and I’ve got the bits o’ things to put
together. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Martha had seen that her own husband was with
the other, and she did not intend him to come
up that garden-path just then if she could help it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good-night!” echoed the little woman, who, if
none so clever as her friend by a long way, saw the
point of what she had said very well. She concealed
the signs of her perturbation as she was bid,
and held out a meek, limp hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good luck,” whispered Martha, seizing the hand
in her powerful grasp. “Mind you put lots o’
spunk into it all!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And as she spoke the words she remembered
the request that had been made to her by her
one-time sweetheart as she came in!</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, she had fulfilled it!</p>

<p class='c001'>And without another word she sped down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>walk, and was out on the downs before Dan Moss
and her husband had reached the gate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, ye be never off in such a darned ’urry!”
cried the former as she came up to them. “I won’t
stand that! Ye’ve got to come back and both on
ye ’ave a drink for old times’ sake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you kindly,” said she. “We don’t often
drink nothin’ but a glass o’ beer o’ dinner-time
don’t Bill and me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ye’ll ’ave to this time,” insisted the man
hospitably. “This pore man o’ yourn’s just pumped
out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, ’e be right enough, bain’t ye, Bill?” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I be right enough,” agreed the man
addressed, and wouldn’t have dared to admit the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A warm posset’s the best thing for ’im when
’e gets to bed. So we’ll just get along and see
to it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She buttoned his coat tight about his throat
as she spoke, and gave him a friendly thump on
the back.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yer wife’s tired,” she added. “She ought to
turn in too. The brat ain’t very old yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tired, be she?” said Moss, and scratched his
head. “Well, if ye won’t, ye won’t,” he added
presently. “So, it’s good-night to ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good-night,” echoed the husband and wife in
one breath as they turned down the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>Moss stood a minute looking after them, whistling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>a rowdy, popular song in a slow, contemplative
sort of way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he turned with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rum lot,” he said to himself as he opened his
garden-gate.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the porch the little wife stood waiting. Her
eyes were dry and there was a pretty smile on her
lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye are nice and early to-night,” she said
affectionately.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, ye asked me to come ’ome early, didn’t
ye?” he whispered, pinching her ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>And she did not say that she always made that
request without it’s being always attended to.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But ye ain’t been lonesome this time,” he
added. “’Aven’t you and Mrs. Hewson had a nice
chat?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she said doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c001'>He laughed his jolly laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye don’t care over much for the woman, I can
see,” chuckled he. “Well, she be a bit rumbustious
though a well-meanin’ wench enough. I used
to half-fancy ’er myself once, but she bain’t my
style, I likes ’em cosier nor that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he drew his wife’s smooth, fair head to his
bosom and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“See ’ere,” said he, “I’ve bought ye a present.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He untied the brown-paper parcel and spread out
a black silk dress.</p>

<p class='c001'>Milly’s eyes shone and she clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“For me! What, niver!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, ain’t it!” he chuckled. “You should ha’
’ad it long ago only I ’adn’t just got the cash
’andy. There!” and he threw it across to her
merrily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You be kind to me, Dan,” whispered she, and
she threw her arms round his neck.</p>

<p class='c001'>Down in the hollow below the downs, Martha
was hurrying her husband along. She had him by
the elbow that she might the better urge him forward,
and whenever he opened his mouth to speak
she bade him hold his tongue, for though the moon
was bright, the wind whistled from the nor’-west
and the air was keen.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she talked for two.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To think of it, Bill!” laughed she. “There were
a time when I was sweet on that great ’ulkin’ chap
up yonder. Yes, and ’e on me, too! We’s changed
our minds since then, ain’t we! He <i>’ave</i> got a little
ninny of a wife and no mistake! I wouldn’t stand
bein’ chucked about as ’e do ’er. So I s’pose we
be both best suited as we be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shouldn’t wonder,” agreed Bill Hewson
through his mufflers.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then they reached the inn and went in to
the warmth, and Martha Hewson saw her husband
to bed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Mother and daughter came toiling up the hill
above the marsh-land, swinging a basket of linen
between them. The daughter was but a little one—just
eleven years old—but beginning to be fit to
help mother a bit: and the mother herself was
scarcely past thirty, though she had three younger
than Sue to care for.</p>

<p class='c001'>They came up fast, for there was a mass of
purple cloud behind the town on the distant hill,
and a still darker bank of it across the horizon out
to sea, and the rain might come down again at any
moment. It had been a bad season for laundresses,
and the drying of clothes a very difficult job; there
was another lot to get home to-night before going
to bed if it could be managed: more than enough
to do, yet not enough with it all to keep the six
mouths filled, and Mrs. Wood was on her way to
try for another family’s work.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You get along ’ome with this, Sue,” she said to
her child; “you can manage the basket alone now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>you be on the top, can’t ye? There be cold bacon
in the cupboard for dinner. You lay it out ready:
I’ve got to step in and see post-mistress. She ’ave
let ’er ’ouse on the ’ill to a family from London.
They say there be lots o’ children, and it’d be a
good job for us if I could get ’er to speak for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ’ope post-mistress won’t be nasty then,” said
the child with wisdom that sat sadly on her chubby
face and seemed to have no place in the innocent,
brown eyes. “She caught father drunk last night
when you guv ’im that postal order to git cashed,
and she went on at ’im h’awful.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The mother’s brow clouded. She seemed to find
nothing strange in the child’s remark; it was evident
that she was wont to make this little eldest daughter
the confidante of her troubles—but her brow clouded
with anger.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did she though?” cried she defiantly, her thin,
delicately pretty face lighting up with a flame that
gave it a momentary brilliancy of colouring. “And
’ose fault was it as father was drunk? It weren’t my
earnin’s nor his’n neither as ’e spent on it, for ’e
didn’t cash the paper till arter! It be them nasty
do-nothin’s at the road-corners as tempts ’im and
treats ’im, for the fun of ’earin’ ’im go on a bit
merry, that’s what it be—and it be a burnin’
shame, it be!”</p>

<p class='c001'>They had reached the top of the hill, and Mrs.
Wood set the basket down on the flags just outside
the doctor’s surgery. There were loiterers even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>now at the corner of the churchyard that was the
centre of the village square, and she had raised her
voice with the last words, and they had smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>She took the corner of her apron and wiped her
mouth, that was quivering a little.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, never you mind, you go ’long ’ome,
dear,” said she softly, as though she were half-ashamed.
“It ain’t ’cos father ’as ’is drop as Miss
’Earn’s so set agin me, noways.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why be it then, mother?” asked the little maid
with natural curiosity. “She do seem to owe you
some grudge, she do. And folks all callin’ of ’er so
pious and Christian-like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never you mind,” repeated the mother again.
“Them pious folk is allers the ones to be down on
their neighbours.” And she stooped and lifted the
basket to the child’s head. “Can ye manage
it?” said she, “or shall I come to the corner with
ye?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, it be all right,” declared Sue, though she
staggered a minute at first. And lifting a tiny
arm to the load to steady it, she set off down the
street towards where the cottages stood so close to
the hill’s edge that one might have jumped off
straight into the waste of blue mist below that was
marsh-land and river unrolling to the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Wood watched her a minute to see that she
was safe, and then she turned her back on the
loiterers and went on towards the post-office.</p>

<p class='c001'>One lad called out a greeting to her and asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>who her mate was with, but she paid no heed
though the others laughed. She shook her spare
shoulders as she walked with a way that she had,
and drew her spare little black jacket around her
and held her little head, that had once been so
pretty, well up, so that the thin nose was tilted,
sniffing the cool air, and any one who knew her
could have told that the next person she met would
“catch it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The loiterers knew it, and laughed as they saw
who the next person would be.</p>

<p class='c001'>For it was her own man who came lounging
across the churchyard. He was a great, hulking
fellow who looked as though he could have taken
the frail little body in one great hand and crushed
it to death, yet the woman showed no fear of him.
She just stood where she was and waited for him
to reach the gate and come through to her, and
though the laughter went on at the corner by
which he must pass, and she knew very well what
the joke was, she was nowise daunted nor even
seemed to notice it.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as the man came closer one could see that
on the top of that great body there was a handsome,
gipsy face with coal-black beard and hair
curling crisply, and dark eyes that might have
flashed if they would, but that were soft and
velvety as those of his own little daughter, while
the mouth smiled almost tremulously, showing a
row of even, white teeth.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>“Why ain’t ye at work?” said the wife as the
Adonis came up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ere, Jerry, I wants a word with ye,” called one
of the young fellows on the wall.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You budge if you dare,” said the little woman,
setting her lips together.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t ye stop to be bullied, man,” laughed
another one yonder. “What be the good of a
good time if ye pay for it next day this way?”</p>

<p class='c001'>But the Adonis only smiled a charming smile,
looking from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why ain’t ye at work?” repeated his wife.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It be close upon dinner-time,” answered the
man good-humouredly. “It weren’t worth while
goin’ up there for less nor ’arf a hour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What—ye don’t mean to tell me ye ’aven’t
been to work at all?” screamed the little woman.
“’Close upon,’ indeed! ’Aven’t ye got turned off
jobs times untold ’cos o’ ‘close upon’? It be allers
‘close upon’ dinner-time or tea-time or leavin’ off
time wi’ you! If Major Dennis turns ye off again,
’e won’t take ye on no more, and you know that
well enough!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wouldn’t stand it, I wouldn’t,” laughed the
demon at the corner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry looked doubtfully from one to the other,
still smiling; then something that was almost a
flash of anger came from the soft, dark eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I be dashed if I do,” said he, taking off
his cap and digging his great fingers into the crisp,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>black curls! “A man must ’ave ’is bit o’ leisure,
damn it all! I’ve worked for the Major nigh upon
five years....”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a roar of laughter at this, and Jerry
himself smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I mean countin’ the off-times,” he added,
without the slightest touch of ill-humour.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The times ’e ’ave turned ye off, ye mean, and
took ye on again, eh?” put in the chorus.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I be darned if I be goin’ to work for ’im
no more if I can’t do it my own way,” concluded
the giant, without regarding the interruption otherwise
than by his pleasant smile. “I ain’t got the
’ealth to keep it up mornin’, noon and night
without so much as a breathing....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Or a whettin’ o’ yer whistle,” slipped in the
other. “Yer back’s too long to stand the stoopin’,
I’ll be bound!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry turned his smile into a laugh in polite
recognition of the witticism, before he added his
ultimatum. “And if ’e bain’t a-goin’ to be reasonable,”
declared he, “well, I shall just chuck it!
I’ve ’eard say there be a gardener wanted up at
the ’Ill, and I shall apply for the sitivation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry drew himself up to all his splendid height
and looked round on his audience with dignity.
But his wife spoiled the whole thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye fool,” snarled she under her breath as this
last proposition met with its well-deserved appreciation
from the loungers; “can’t ye see as they be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>all a-laughin’ at ye? ’Ow are ye goin’ for to get a
sitivation without no character? Come ’long ’ome
do, for mercy’s sake, and ’ave yer dinner and get to
work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She clutched at his arm to lead him away as
she was sometimes able to do when he was in a
good mood; for Jerry always found it easier to
please anybody than to say them “nay,” and often
would patiently do even his wife’s bidding—provided
he was not in his cups—when he could, alas!
descend even to the boot or the kitchen-poker at
his need. But to-day, unluckily his wife was demanding
submission when others were by to see,
and these others the very ones over whom his wit
had gained a supremacy of its own the night
before in the hour of carouse. What man could
brook this—least of all what man who had his
position for popularity to maintain?</p>

<p class='c001'>He drew his arm away.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I tell ye the Major ’ll ’ave to be’ave very
different to me afore I work for ’im agin,” reiterated
he, and as the woman still nudged him: “You go
and mind the children, Lucy,” he added loftily,
“and leave me ’lone. Women-folk ain’t supposed
to understand these ’ere things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His supporters cheered him loudly at this, and
he moved across towards them, but Lucy Wood
was not easily to be set aside. She knew that her
influence with <i>him</i> was for the moment in abeyance,
but she turned to her tormentors.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Ain’t ye ashamed o’ yerselves, a pack o’ idle
young vagabonds, to sit there and make fun of a
man as ’d ha’ been a good ’un enough if it weren’t
for you and your likes?” cried she passionately.
“If <i>you</i> ’aven’t got no one to work for—though
Lord knows there’s mothers dependin’ on ye if
there ain’t wives and childer—can’t ye ’ave the
grace to leave them alone as ’<i>as</i>?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman’s voice was breaking, if not her
spirit, and she had to pause for breath. A little
bantam cock of a man, older than the rest, took
his pipe from his mouth and snarled out an ugly
oath at her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry, who wore a vexed look on his handsome
face, murmured deprecatingly, “Easy, easy, mate!”
but the man only retorted: “Well, send ’er ’ome
and don’t be rid over by yer women-folk so meeklike,
man,” and the giant, anxious to keep his
good footing with his comrades, bid his wife once
more be gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You come ’ome to yer dinner and leave talkin’
stuff as ye can’t act up to and I’ll let ye be,” was
all she said, and added, catching a nasty look in
the little man’s face, and seeing the ill effect it was
having on her own man: “Oh, I know what ye be
up to, Casey, and it won’t be the first time ye’ve
played me a bad turn this way, if it be the last.
But I don’t care for your bad words, not I! It be
your sort as be the curse o’ my man, and I’ll save
’im from ye if I can.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>It was an ill-judged remark, and she paid dearly
for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Away from his mates Jerry might have been
docile, but supported by them he was not going to
be wife-ridden.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You go ’ome and I’ll come when I please,”
repeated he doggedly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy Wood knew the mood and knew that it
was idle to fight it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dinner-time’s dinner-time to-day,” was all she
said. “Sue and me ’as got a sight a linen to get
done, and I shall clear away sharp.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s a wife for ye,” said Casey facetiously.
“Don’t let’s you and me get spliced, lads! That
be ’ow the women study a man!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I pity the one as ’ll ’ave to study you, Jim
Casey!” retorted Lucy. “And may be if she’ve
got to earn the money as well as feed the childer,
she won’t get time to study no one much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She turned as she spoke, and drew her jacket
together with her old pettish movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That be a nasty one!” laughed Casey. “But
if I was ‘cheeked’ like that, I be blowed if I’d
give a woman what I earned! No, I’d keep it for
myself, I would.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy turned quickly. Up till now she had
known well enough he would come home sooner
or later, since he had no money wherewith to buy
victuals. But now a sudden uneasiness seized
her.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“’E ain’t got any now, any ways,” said she,
looking at him. “’E don’t get ’is wage till to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry quailed beneath her gaze. To do him
justice, he had forgotten till this very moment that
he had money in his pocket: it was such a very rare
occurrence. His master, owing to a sudden departure,
had paid him his due the evening before;
he had faithfully promised to take it straight to his
wife, but the tempters had come along, and a good
part of it had already gone in the carouse of the
night, which <i>she</i> supposed he had owed to his
friends.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Old on, Jerry; stick to it, man!” came from
the group.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ve never got your wage by now,” asked
Lucy almost incredulously.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not answer, and her face went white;
she had counted on this rare week’s money of his
for so many little debts.</p>

<p class='c001'>He lowered his eyes—he was genuinely sorry.
The sight of her frail little body quivering with
anxiety, of her frail little face going paler because
of his selfish cruelty, reminded him vaguely of the
day when she had been near to leaving him in
consequence of what the doctor had called “grinding
herself to death for a good-for-nothing husband.”
He wondered if she was going to faint
again now, as she had done then, when he had
thought she was dead, and his heart turned sick.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>But she did not faint—his silence had told her the
truth, and she pulled herself together, as she always
did in an emergency. She said nothing; she knew
there was nothing more to be said—<i>then</i>; she just
left him and went on up the road. But when she
had gone a little way she turned half round and
waited, and her man came up a few steps towards
her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll leave the cold bacon on the table ready for
you,” said she, quite gently. “I may ’ave to go out
with the linen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Keep it up, old man,” came Casey’s rasping
tones up the path, followed by a brutal laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jerry faced about towards him once more, and
Lucy disappeared round the corner. She had no
heart for the post-mistress then, and indeed she
half guessed that that inquisitive woman had witnessed
the scene on the green through the window-frame
behind which she dispensed postal conveniences
and morality to the village; it was bad
enough to face Miss Hearn when she had no
special reason to crow over one—it was impossible
when she had.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy was quite right. Miss Hearn had seen
and heard everything, and was discussing it now
with the doctor’s housekeeper, who had come in to
send a postal order to her son.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor soul!” the latter was saying in kindly
commiserating tones, “I feel right down sorry for
’er, I do! A-slavin’ and a-killin’ of ’erself workin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>for that good-for-nothin’ lazy-bones! And a confinement
thrown in most Christmas-times. Why,
there’s been one every year since they was wed,
to my certain knowledge—and there couldn’t be no
more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since they was what?” repeated Miss Hearn,
pursing her lips and wagging her head till the long,
sleek ringlets on either side of her round, furrowed
face shook sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, they <i>was</i> wed, though it might ha’ been
sooner,” said the other, blushing a little, but smiling
a little too; “there was only one of ’em born out
o’ wedlock after all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ain’t one enough?” retorted the post-office
lady distantly. “I scarce call it a wedding myself—when
it ain’t at the right time. If that sort o’
thing weren’t made light of among ye, it wouldn’t
’appen. It ought not to be tolerated. It’s a disgrace
to the parish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Lucy <i>was</i> looked askance at at first,”
answered the other, who, as the doctor’s right hand
for many a year, considered herself competent to
argue a question even with the post-office mistress.
“I allers passed her by on the other side o’ the
road myself. But ye must allow she did make ’im
marry ’er, and virtue ’ave got to be rewarded,
’aven’t it? Else it ain’t no good a-practisin’ of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Virtue!” sniffed Miss Hearn. “A tardy reparation
don’t wipe out sin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I ain’t a-goin’ to defend sin,” said the elder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>woman hastily. “And o’ course Lucy ’adn’t no
business to go runnin’ along dark lanes wi’ the
man on moonlight nights! But there, the gal did
what she could to make up—for you won’t go for
to deny it wanted a bit o’ pluck to tie ’erself up to
’im! Why, it’s my belief, ’e beat ’er when ’e was
drunk afore they was so much as wed—not to
say nothink o’ goin’s on with them gals at the
’Arbour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wonder at yer bringin’ yer mouth to speak o’
such things,” said the post-mistress severely. “And
if you ask me, I’d ’ave said pitch was best let alone
anyways.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But the humbler Chapel-goer was not daunted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I never!” ejaculated she. “And you, a
Church-woman! You’d never ’ave ’ad ’er not give
Sue a name?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“For one she give a name to, she’s brought three
into the world to own a drunken sot and evil-liver
for a father!” sneered Miss Hearn. “’Tis writ the
sins o’ the fathers shall be visited on the children.
No, no, you take my word for it,” added the lady
dictatorially, “the sinful passions o’ man—not to
say woman—is the root o’ the whole o’ that there
business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never thought o’ that,” declared the housekeeper,
a trifle shaken in her opinion. “Not but
what I can’t deny she were dead gone on ’im. But,
there, anyways she do ’ave a life on it,” she
added irrelevantly; “and I do think ye might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>give ’er that job o’ work if ye could manage it,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Hearn pursed her lips and moved away to
fetch the order which both women had forgotten
in the eagerness of their gossip.</p>

<p class='c001'>This request put her back on the pedestal of her
dignity.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think o’ the example, ma’am,” she whispered,
her eyelids positively quivering with righteousness
as she proceeded to her work. “I’ve done more
for Mrs. Wood than I should ha’ done a’ready.
Many’s the time I’ve overlooked it when she were
late with my rent. And yet she earns as good as
most, and I didn’t ought to. We must think o’
the deservin’ fust.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, she ’ave done the best she could for ’er
childer ye must allow,” argued the other. “They’s
the cleanest and best be’aved children in the village—everybody
says so—and allers at school, ’cept
Sue, as stays to ’elp ’er mother now. Nobody can’t
say but what Lucy Wood ’aven’t toiled for ’em all,
and ’alf killed ’erself too! The master told me if
ever she was to ’ave another turn same as that
she ’ad last winter, she couldn’t get over it no-ways.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Folk must lie as they’ve made their beds,”
repeated Miss Hearn, pitilessly. “If she ’ad ha’
kep’ ’erself <i>to</i> ’erself she wouldn’t ha’ ’ad no sich
turns at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ye can’t expect girls to bide single,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>began the other; but the post-mistress handed her
postal order with: “Six and sixpence, ma’am,
please,” in such a business-like voice that the
torrent of her speech was checked.</p>

<p class='c001'>She took out the money sadly. She had seen
trouble enough in the doctor’s house to have a
kindly corner in her heart, disciplinarian though
she professed herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nobody wouldn’t deny but what poor Lucy
would ha’ done better if she ’adn’t never ha’
seen that Jerry,” she began again; “and if the
Lord was to be minded to take ’im, o’ course
she could do much better for ’erself and the
childer....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That may be <i>very</i> like,” interrupted the tyrant
sternly. “Nevertheless, ye’ll please not to take
the Lord’s name in vain on <i>my</i> premises! We
poor sinners ain’t got nothin’ to do wi’ the ways o’
Providence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No offence,” said the visitor cheerily. “I’m sure
<i>I</i> don’t want to presume to interfere with Them
above; and p’r’aps Lucy mightn’t be pleased,
though it would make things so much easier for
’er. She do seem sot on ’im still, don’t she? I
often wonder,” she added confidentially, “if she
guesses as ’e ain’t true to ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Hearn assumed a more shocked expression
than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When a woman ’ave so far forgot ’erself there’s
<i>no</i> length she won’t go to!” said she sententiously.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“She ain’t never ’ad no proper pride—and she
won’t get it now. Always a-defendin’ and a-upholdin’
o’ ’im! It’s terrible to witness!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, it’s my belief she loves ’im still,” said the
doctor’s housekeeper reflectively.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then the postman came in with the mail-bag,
and the post-mistress was forced to make up
for lost time, and look sharp stamping the letters.
The visitor hastened to depart.</p>

<p class='c015'>If she could have seen the object of her good-natured
consideration a few hours later she would
certainly have been inclined to endorse her own
opinion that Lucy loved him still.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the day long she had been watching for him,
and no cries of children nor weary attention to
work, nor quaint, practical comfort from her wise
little first-born, could dull her ear to every footstep
along the stony road outside, or steel her heart
against the silent misery that was slowly creeping
around and upon it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Father had not been home either to dinner or to
tea. She had sent Sue to the Major’s, but he had
not been there all day. She had even been herself
to the “Public” on the village green to ferret
out news of him, but no one had met him since
they had seen them together that morning on the
churchyard corner, and she began to feel pretty
sure now that he had gone on the spree to some
more distant “diggings,” as he was wont to do at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>times when he was thoroughly in with his bad
companions and wanted to be out of reach of her
“worritin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ’spect ’e be down at the Arbour,” moaned she
to the little daughter who sat laboriously darning
a pair of stockings at her side, while she herself
passed the iron up and down over the fine damask
table-linen belonging to her best customers up at
the “house.” And her gaze crept out of the
window across the marsh-land that swept to the
sea from the base of the cliff, on whose crest their
cottage stood. She could not see “the Harbour,”
as the villagers called it, for it was three miles away
where the river oozed through muddy banks to
the sea, but she could see a bit of the long white
road upon which he would come when he started
homewards.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There were a brig due to-night,” she added,
“and father do like to be by when there be a brig
due—the fellers keep so merry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She was silent a moment, taking up her goffering-tongs
to goffer a pillow-case frill and holding
them to her cheek to test the heat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, I do wish I ’adn’t been such a silly as to
let out to Jim Casey this morning!” she went on
presently. “I might ha’ knowed ’e’d pay me out
somehow. ’E allers does.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I <i>’ate</i> Jim Casey,” said the child, lifting serious
brown eyes to her mother’s face, for all the world
like her father’s.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“And the Lord knows <i>I</i> do,” declared the
mother peevishly. “It be all ’is fault as father be
as ’e be. ’E ’ave done more ’arm than the Lord
knows in this world, ’ave Casey.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child was silent. She didn’t understand,
but she wasn’t meant to understand, and she didn’t
want to. She was used to having her mother run
on to her in an endless, peevish moan when things
were “contrairy,” and she liked to sit and listen
and feel important without knowing why.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d like to pay Casey out some day, and no
mistake,” said the mother vindictively.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the little girl echoed the sentiment, looking
up again with her frank eyes in which vindictiveness
had not yet learned to dwell. “Do, mother,”
she said, being sure of one thing only, and that
was that she did not like Jim Casey, because he
somehow worked her father ill.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mother’s face did not relax; she went on
ironing desperately, slapping the iron on to the
linen and dropping it heavily on to the stand again.
But presently she looked up; she was folding the
last table-napkin, and she laid it on the pile. Her
eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Father ’ll be ’ome soon, I ’spect,” said Sue
gently, watching her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Lord knows,” sighed the mother, and if
the child had had more worldly wisdom she would
have guessed that a fresh sting had crept into her
misery; “there be no tellin’! But <i>you</i> ’aven’t got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>no need to worrit. You go and bring the children
in from their play, and get ’em washed, and the
supper spread, there’s a good child. I ’ope they
’aven’t strayed far.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She put up the back of her hand and dried her
eyes as she stepped to the door whence a flight of
brick stairs led to the road along the cliff’s edge.</p>

<p class='c001'>All day long storm-clouds had been circling
round the distant sister town, and sweeping up
across the marsh from the sea, piling themselves
together thick and dark, and emptying their
heaviness upon the wide, sad land. But, with the
westering sun, they had lightened a bit, and there
were holes in them that let the blue through in
patches, and, above the ramparts of purple downs
that enclosed the land that had once been water,
they had parted now, leaving a long red line
between their own murkiness and the sombre hue
of the hills below: in one place the red was of
blood, and the black arms of the windmill on the
down’s crest made a cross upon it as of a Calvary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Wood did not notice the sunset, but she
sighed as she looked out into the waste below,
where, slowly and steadily, thick mists were rising
from the dykes, or stealthily creeping across the
marsh-land.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My, it ’ave rained a lot,” said she, “the river
be big. And I shouldn’t be surprised if we ’ad a
nasty sea-fog to-night too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” said the child smiling with quick intention,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“father knows ’is way ’cross the marsh, well
enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I don’t s’pose ’e be likely to lose ’is way
at this time o’ day, drunk or sober,” allowed the
mother, with another sigh. “That ain’t all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then she shaded her eyes and made out
two dark and two fair-haired curly heads in the
group of children playing in the road, and called
out to them to come in to bed. She caught the
last, the youngest, who was a boy, in her arms as
he came up the steps and hugged him, and laughed
for the first time that day as he kicked and
struggled to get free.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They’re in a rare mess, Sue,” she called out to
the little elder sister. “You’d best give ’em their
supper first, while I step up wi’ the linen. I won’t
be long, but I must look in at the Post-office
’bout that there job or I’ll be too late. Leave
washin’ o’ Johnnie till I come in; ’e’ll be too much
for you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She passed back into the dwelling-room, taking
off her apron and rolling down her sleeves as she
went.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The shirts can wait till the mornin’,” she added.
“They want some airin’ yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ’ope ye’ll get the work at the new ’ouse,
mother,” said Sue cheerily as her mother went
down the road; and she set the little brothers and
sisters around sitting on the doorstep and gave
them their milk and dry bread for supper.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>But the luck was not in Mrs. Wood’s way that
day; the job was gone before she got to the Post-office.
Miss Hearn assured her curtly that it had
been gone before she knew of her wanting it; it
had gone to Widow Collins.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should ha’ thought ye might ha’ guessed I
should want it fast enough, ma’am,” said poor Lucy
humbly. “Widow Collins ain’t got no mouths to
feed now ’er son’s provided for, and I don’t never
’ave work enough, wi’ all I can get to feed them as
counts upon me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I’m sorry for ye,” said the post-mistress,
though her tone belied her words, “but I’m bound
to speak fair and honest to strangers accordin’ to
what I’m asked, ye know. And folk will put
awkward questions sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Wood flushed hot.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Tain’t fair, then,” said she, her voice trembling,
but whether she alluded to the question that had
been put, or to the answer that had been given, she
did not specify. “If I do my work proper, and up
to time, I don’t think nothink else ain’t nobody’s
business.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s as may be,” retorted the superior, pursing
her lips, and Lucy Wood went home.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had heard no word of her husband—nothing
but that Jim Casey had gone to the sea-port, and
thither she was forced to suppose Jerry had gone
too.</p>

<p class='c001'>She washed her boy and put him to bed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>bade Sue turn in too, and when she had damped
the linen ready for the morrow’s final ironing, she
put a light in the window, in case Jerry should come
by the top way, and closing the front door softly,
slunk shyly down to the wall at the end of the
road to watch for that home-coming that she
longed for and yet dreaded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many a time had she thus watched and waited
before, but somehow to-night there was on her a
deeper and more incomprehensible fear than she
had ever known.</p>

<p class='c001'>A horrible and sinister sense of mystery seemed
to hang over everything: the moon was struggling
with clouds that continually overswept and swamped
her, and even when she looked forth it was with
no mild radiance, but as though coldly trying to
pierce some cruel secret; white and dense the sea-fog
overspread the marsh like a blanket, swaying
even up to the village on the cliff and floating
softly down its streets and around its old church in
the big square graveyard. One could scarcely see
a yard in front of one, and two men who came
smartly up the hill and round the corner did not
see Lucy as she hung over the wall peering down
the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pore Mrs. Wood, she’ll ’ave a job wi’ ’im
to-night, she will!” said one with a laugh. “I
often wonders whether she guesses the worst on
’im and just keeps dark on it for ’er pride’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye never can tell wi’ folk,” said the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>sagely. “The gals from the ’Arbour don’t often
come up this way, and I don’t s’pose no one’d go
for to tell ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord love ye, ye can’t never tell what nasty
turn one woman’d do another,” declared Wilson.
“Though I dare say she’d sooner put up wi’ it all
than be rid on ’im, if the truth was known. It be
past crediting what some women’ll look over in a
man as they love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He started, for he felt a touch on his arm in the
mist, and looking round recognized Lucy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I was thinkin’ p’r’aps ye might ha’ seen my
’usband down at the ’Arbour, Mr. Wilson,” said she
in a thin, panting voice, that told of inner anguish
bravely concealed. “’E ain’t come ’ome yet, and
it be a nasty aitchy night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The man turned away his eyes from her miserable,
eager face and looked at his comrade.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, don’t ye worrit, Mrs. Wood,” said the latter
after a minute, during which the two looked blankly
at one another. “Jerry be all right. We did see
’im down yonder, but ’e be wi’ a lot of ’em, and
they’ll bring ’im ’ome, you can make sure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bring him home! The words had an ominous
sound, and she did not dare ask more.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked wistfully down the hill—or down as
much of it as one could see in the damp, creeping
atmosphere; the long, weary road across the lonely
plain, with the sad swish of the waves coming
nearer the further one went, till one reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>place where only white stones by the dyke’s side
marked the way across the marsh to the harbour—it
was all vividly present to her mind’s eye, and
she knew it was no safe spot for a drunken man to
cross in a thick fog.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E might want to leave and come ’ome afore
the others was ready,” she said in the same thin,
high voice. “I’ve ’alf a mind to go ’long the road
to meet ’im.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord love ye, Mrs. Wood, ye mustn’t do no
such thing,” said the man whom she had called
Wilson, authoritatively. “The mist be as thick as
mush on the marsh, and it wouldn’t be safe. Your
man be all right. The boys wouldn’t never leave
’im—I know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She sighed; the assertion made it plainer than
ever to her in what condition they had last seen
him. She drew the old shawl that she had caught
up in her haste tightly round her elbows and
shivered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You go ’ome to the childer,” said the man
kindly. “They be little uns; they needs ye most,
ye know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank ye,” retorted she sharply, “I knows best
for myself where’s I be most needed. The childer’s
in bed and asleep these hours gone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she turned back to her old place by the
wall, leaning on it and gazing down into the
marsh.</p>

<p class='c001'>The men walked on, and were gone in the mist.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>It was the last mortification that could be laid
on her—that folk should <i>know</i>—what she had
known for long. But she was too actually sodden
with misery to care as she would have cared a year
or two ago. For she knew it—oh, yes, she knew
it all! But she had never let any one guess that
she knew it, least of all him. Perhaps it was
because of her pride, as the man had surmised;
perhaps it was because she had a vague hope that
by silence and patience she would best strengthen
the thread that still held him to her. She was only
a simple woman, but she understood him pretty
well, and she knew that the thread was there; she
knew that it was weakness that led him away
from her—weakness fortified by evil counsel and
evil comradeship. And in the darkness she
clenched her poor horny little hand and prayed
that she might be even with Casey some day.</p>

<p class='c001'>And meanwhile she waited, shivering in the fog,
and her heart went out in passionate longing to
the man who was faithless to her, who neglected
her, who squandered her earnings, and was slowly
bringing her to the grave. Wilson had said: “It’s
past crediting what some women’ll look over in
the man they love!”</p>

<p class='c001'>But the minutes flew fast and grew into a long
hour, and there was no sign of Jerry, and at last
the wife had to remember the mother and go home
to the babes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little Sue stirred.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Be that father?” asked she drowsily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, dear, not yet. You go to sleep,” said the
mother,</p>

<p class='c001'>“But ye won’t fret, mother, will you?” said the
child again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, no, dear, I won’t fret,” promised the poor
soul, though her voice would have given the lie to
her words had the child not been dulled with
healthy weariness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The little one turned round in bed, and the
mother sat herself by the window wrapping her
shawl more closely around her.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she did not keep her promise—she did fret.
She sat and rocked herself to and fro, and thought
of all she might have done which she had not done,
and of all she had done that would have best been
left undone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, she had worried him; she had been too
sharp, too fretful. She had not been able to make
life gay for him—there were always so many cares;
and he hated cares and loved gaiety.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only that very morning she had found fault with
him, and been cross to him before strangers; any
man would hate that, and he hated it more than
most. Why had she been so foolish? No wonder
he had gone to the Harbour and to “them ’orrid
girls.” It was her own fault. But when he came
home, she would not speak a word of reproach.
He should just sleep it off and not a word said.
And she would get credit somehow to get him nice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>dinners. If only it weren’t that nasty old Miss
Hearn to whom the rent was due!</p>

<p class='c001'>And so she sat and planned and waited, and the
lamp burned low, but he did not come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sleep won on her after her hard day’s work and
she dozed off, and as she dozed she thought she
was in the steep lane again where her Jerry had
courted her first, and she felt the scent of pines
after a hot day sweet in her nostrils, and the breath
of kisses sweeter still upon her lips, and the soft
tenderness of the warm moonlight slowly persuading
her happy senses.</p>

<p class='c001'>And she awoke with a start.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was moonlight without, but it was wan and
chill, and the only scent was a scent of salt sea
spray that was borne in upon the fog: but there
was a sound of voices in the night.</p>

<p class='c001'>In a moment her hand was on the latch, and she
was out on the threshold above the brick steps.</p>

<p class='c001'>A man and a woman were coming up them, but
the man was not her husband. It was Mr. Wilson,
whom she had seen earlier in the evening—whom
she had overheard—wondering “if she knew.” A
sudden wave of anger against him swept over her,
the foam of the mortification that she had so long
endured.</p>

<p class='c001'>The blood went to her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What d’ye want?” said she savagely, standing
at the top of her steps as though to guard her
threshold.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>But even as she spoke the words, the wave had
passed over her, leaving her cold and shivering.
For Wilson was silent, and there was a look of pity
on his plain face. She looked at the woman: it
was the doctor’s old housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What do ye want?” she repeated, but there
was less fierceness in the voice now: it was half
plaintive, half peevish.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman came two steps further up, but still
Lucy guarded her threshold.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush!” she whispered hoarsely, “don’t wake
the childer. If there be trouble, say so. It won’t
be nothin’ new for ye to tell me my man be drunk.
Ye be all on yer pleased enough to come and say
so. And if the truth was known I dare say ye
wouldn’t mind sayin’ as ’e’d been down with the
bad girls at the ’Arbour as well,” added she recklessly.
“You be all on yer glad enough to say
every bit o’ ill ye can on us both. Oh, yes, I know
’ow you and Miss ’Earn lays yer ’eads together
agin me,” cried she, working up her anger the
better to drown her fear. “I s’pose ye think it do
but serve me right if ’e should treat me bad seein’
as I made myself too cheap to ’im at first. Oh,
yes, don’t mind me—say it out, do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She ended in a whimper, and the old woman
looked helplessly back at the man who waited
lower down.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whativer shall we do wi’ ’er?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Wilson moved up.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Look ’ere,” said he firmly, “we ain’t come to
say no such things as you fancy. We means kindly
by ye—we wants to ’elp ye all we can. For there
<i>be</i> trouble, missus, and ye got to brace up to
meet it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” repeated the old woman, “ye’ve got to
brace yerself up and keep yerself quiet, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy drew her shawl very tightly about her, and
came down to them, driving them, as it were,
before her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want no noise ’ere,” she said surlily.
“Where be ’e?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E be at the doctor’s,” said Wilson.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, ’e be at the master’s,” repeated the woman—“there’ve
been a bit of a h’accident....”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy pushed past her, and hurried round the
corner and up the hill; the two had hard work to
keep up with her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Casey be in it,” she muttered to herself. “Casey
done it, I know. I’d like to be even wi’ Casey!”
Then turning, she said fiercely, “Where be ’e?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who?” asked Wilson.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Casey,” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E be ... ’e be took up,” answered the man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her face positively shone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, took by the perlice?” she cried, clutching
his arm. “Will ’e go to prison?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, yes, ’e’ll go to prison,” said the man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Lord be praised!” she said, stopping
dead.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The old woman, who had been unable to keep
the pace, caught them up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look ’ere, ye must look sharp,” she panted, “if
ye want to see ’im alive, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Alive? Who?” asked Lucy stupidly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old woman glanced at the man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought ye’d told ’er,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy gazed at them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If ye mean as Casey ’ave killed my Jerry,” she
began slowly, trembling as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E ain’t dead, my dear, ’e ain’t dead yet,”
faltered the old housekeeper.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy began to run.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Anyways it weren’t the blow Casey ’it ’im as
done for ’im, Mrs. Wood,” panted Wilson, keeping
up with her, “Nobody don’t love Casey, but
’tweren’t all ’is fault. There <i>were</i> a bit of a brawl—over
a gal. Jerry was drunk, ’e ’it out. Then
the perlice come. Somebody did say Casey split
on Jerry, but if ’e did ’e be paid for it. For t’other
boys ’elped Jerry off—’e was allers a favourite with
’em—and Casey, seein’ ’isself left-like, ’it out at
the perlice. Nobody knows the rights o’t, but
Casey be took up. So’d Jerry ha’ been if ’e ’adn’t
come by that fall on the bridge. ’E was blind-drunk,
and ’e missed ’is foot in the mist.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Casey done it,” was all Lucy said. “’Oo’s fault
was it as ’e were drunk?” And she ran on.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lights appeared faintly before her through the
murky mist; they shone from the doctor’s house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>at the corner of the churchyard. The moon,
piercing the clouds for a moment, threw a wan
light on the square tower of the old church, on the
summit of its massive buttresses, on the lopped
pine-tree beyond; but it was too feeble to illumine
the dank vapours that floated through the ghostly
arches of the ruined transepts and rested, almost
opaquely, on the tops of the time-worn tombstones
in the graveyard.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a little knot of folk in the road hard
by the surgery door; the same lads were there
who had stood at the same corner in the morning,
goading the wife to frenzy with their careless taunts,
merrily “chaffing” the man whom they had now
carried home to die: they stood aside, shamed and
silent, to let the widow pass.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doctor appeared in the doorway; he was a
rough old man, and he had often roughly upbraided
this woman for bringing children into the world at
the risk of her life—children whom she was too
frail to suckle and too poor to properly feed; but
he took her kindly by the hand now.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come,” said he gently.</p>

<p class='c001'>Something in his voice told her the truth: she
looked at him wildly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet she would not understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where be ’e? I must see ’im alone,” she said,
always speaking in that hard, high voice. “We
had words this mornin’ when we parted ... it
were that Casey’s fault ... I <i>must</i> tell Jerry....”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“Hush!” said the doctor, solemnly, interrupting
her. “You shall see him. But you must be brave—for
the sake of your children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, never mind the children,” cried she, half-petulantly.
“I want Jerry....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush!” said the doctor again. And he led
her within into the surgery where those lights were
burning that she had seen through the mist as she
ran—cursing Casey in her heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a deep silence for a moment, and
then those without heard a great cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor soul!” murmured the old housekeeper,
wiping her eyes. “He were a bad man to ’er, God
knows! But—there—she loved ’im to the last, I
do b’lieve.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A year had passed away. It was autumn again,
and Lucy Wood sat out on the threshold above
her brick steps and gazed down into the marsh, and
across it to the distant town and harbour. Her
delicately fair face was wan and shrivelled, her
eyes dull and sunken, her slender form now
emaciated. She had been very ill. The doctor
had given her up, but he had done all he could
though he guessed well enough she could never
pay him, and to-day he had sent his trusty housekeeper
with a bowl of her special milk-broth, and
to induce her to take a breath of fresh air in the
late September sunshine. For it was no stormy
September this year: the marsh lay brown and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>mellow with the hips and haws red on its hedges,
and the river stealing across it to the sea; and the
sea was dappled with the pale purple shadows cast
upon its gently heaving surface by little fleecy
puffs in the serenest of skies, that was only barred
by the violet horizontal clouds of fine weather
across the distance.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the fine weather brought none of its peace
to the widow; the placid sunshine seemed only to
make her the more gloomy, as though she were
fretting to have even the mist back again on the
marsh—the mist through which she had so often
listened and trembled—the mist that brought her
the keenest memory of the worst, yet the best,
that she had ever known on earth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one had said that when Lucy Wood got
over the shock she would “’ave ’er ’ealth again”
as she had never had it through the last five years
of her wretched married life, and Miss Hearn had
been “pleased to think that the misguided woman
wouldn’t ’ave nothing now to take ’er off them pore
children as she ’ad been so wicked as to bring into
this weary world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But every one had been wrong.</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Hearn had been shocked to see that the
children looked less neat than formerly, and were
more rarely sent to school, and shook her curls
quite viciously when she declared that she should
turn the woman out after all if she didn’t pay her
rent next quarter; and Miss Hearn would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>been more bitter than ever if she had heard the
whisper that ran round to the effect that poor Lucy
had been known to take her drop of comfort at
times when she was most low. But the kindlier
neighbours kept her secret and tried to screen her.
Only they shook their heads too when the scarlet
fever appeared in the village, and Tom and
’Lizabeth took it, and the doctor upbraided the
mother for carelessness, and perhaps they might
have been more down upon her still, but that the
boy died, and the mother collapsed entirely, so
that there was nothing for it but to help with the
other children and nurse the woman—because there
was no one else to do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thanks to these good folk and the handy and
patient little elder daughter, Lucy was creeping
slowly back to life again, but it was helplessly and
unwillingly, and the doctor’s old housekeeper was
trying to put a little spirit into her this pleasant
autumn day.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, it’s a real treat to see ye out again, my
dear,” she was saying cheerily. “And ye look
nicely; don’t she, Sue?” she called to the little
girl who was tidying up busily within.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child came to the door to shake a duster;
her plump, rosy checks were thinner and sallower
than of yore, and her round, brown eyes less bright.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she said, speaking cheerfully, but looking
across rather doubtfully at the invalid; “mother
do look a bit spryer.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Why, ye’d be about agin in no time if ye’d but
use a little h’effort yerself,” declared the old woman.
“Doctor says so, and I’m sure ’e’d ought to know,
seein’ as ’e brought ye through them h’awful times
ye used to ’ave afore yer ’usbin’ was took.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy’s white face flushed as with anger.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I didn’t ’ave no sich h’awful times as I’ve ’ad
since!” she whined. “There was summit to get
better for then.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child bit her lip and went indoors. There
was silence for a moment while one could hear her
clattering the irons down to the fire ready for the
bit of laundry-work she was trying hard to keep
pace with against the time mother should be fit to
take it up again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t ought to talk so, Mrs. Wood,” said
the woman. “What, ’aven’t ye got your childer?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What ye’ve got don’t giv ye back what ye
’aven’t got,” she said, in the same peevish tone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But ye ought to think o’ yer duty,” said the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy flushed again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I’ve done my duty ’s well as most,” she
said. “I don’t feel no call to be ’shamed. As for
the gals, Sue be fit for service now, and I’ve ’eard
of a place for ’er down town, and my sister ’ave
promised to ’ave ’Lizabeth out to the ’Arbour till
she be old enough to do for ’erself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ain’t ye afraid o’ lettin’ a gal grow up at the
’Arbour?” said the woman. “Don’t ye know what
most o’ them comes to? And they do say....”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“What do they say?” cried Lucy fiercely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lor’ a mercy,” said the woman, “ye didn’t
ought to catch a body up so sharp. I was only a-goin’
to say as they do say the air down by them
mud-banks ain’t ’ealthy for growin’ childer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, was that all?” said the widow, turning her
face away.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman beside her shook her head, and
lifted her eyes as much as to say that this was
altogether past her comprehension; then, presently,
as though to start a new subject of conversation,
she said, cheerfully:</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ave ye ’eard as that Jim Casey ’ave got two
years this time? ’E did ought to ha’ got it long
ago, but....”</p>

<p class='c001'>She stopped suddenly, for Sue had come up
behind her and was tugging at her dress and
making signs to her behind the mother’s back.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first the old woman only gaped at the child,
but slowly she seemed to grasp the situation, and
nodding and winking at her knowingly, finished up
lamely enough with: “but there, never mind, it
don’t signify.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The sick woman turned round and saw the
child.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye don’t need to worry, Sue,” said she, in just
the same spiritless tone as before. “I don’t take
no ’eed o’ Jim Casey now. There was a time I’d
ha’ been pleased to be even with ’im for a-leadin’
astray of yer pore father but, Lor’, ’tain’t no use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>now. I thought I was pleased ’e’d come to grief
that night ’e done ’is worst, but, Lor’, it didn’t
bring me my man back, and I don’t know now as
it ’d ’elp me if Jim Casey was to swing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lor’ a mercy!” ejaculated the old woman
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>And Sue wiped away a tear with the corner of
her little apron; but the mother did not heed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come, there, now,” said the housekeeper, presently,
“if ’ere don’t come post-mistress to cheer
ye up a bit! She told me she should step up
this arternoon to see ye ’bout the family’s washin’
up at the ’Ill. Old Widow Collins died last week,
ye know, and she thinks she can git it for ye,
may be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want none o’ Miss ’Earn’s favours,”
snapped Lucy. “She wouldn’t gi’ me the job
when I wanted it—she can keep it now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I’m sure,” sighed the other. “Ye didn’t
ought to be so ungrateful, ye didn’t. Anyways,
ye’ll ’ave to tell her so yerself, for I’m sure I
won’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I’ll tell ’er,” said Lucy.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the old woman stood aside in the doorway
as the post-mistress—the pink of respectability in
rusty black—came slowly up the steps.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pleased to see ye yerself again,” said she, in
tones that were meant to be kind.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you,” replied Lucy curtly. “I’m not
sure as I know what that is.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Miss Hearn stared. She was forced to suppose
that illness had affected Mrs. Wood’s brain, for a
mere laundress could never dare be impertinent
to <i>her</i>!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, anyways on the road to work again,” said
she conciliatingly. “And I’ve brought ye a nice
job,” she went on, with a patronizing shake of her
greasy black ringlets. "Pore old Mrs. Collins ’ave
gone at last"—this with a pious closing of the lids
over the little black eyes—“so I’ve asted the missus
at the ‘’Ill ’ouse’ to take ye on i’stead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank ye; I ain’t fit for no more work yet,”
said the widow ungraciously.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nonsense!” declared the post-mistress authoritatively.
“Ye’re in a good way to be better nor
ever ye’ve been in yer life, ain’t she, ma’am?”
turning to the old housekeeper, who still stood
aside.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The master do say she ’ave pulled through
wonderful,” allowed the person addressed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ain’t never goin’ to be the same no more,”
declared Lucy obstinately, setting her lips tightly,
and drawing her skinny little body together with
her own petulant movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye ’aven’t got no business to talk so,” persisted
the post-mistress sharply. “Ye can be what you
choose.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I ain’t goin’ to be no different, then,”
repeated Lucy doggedly. “And I won’t take in
no more work, thank ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>She tried to rise, but Miss Hearn held her with
a mighty eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Woman, do you know as you’re settin’ up yer
’orn against the Lord God A’mighty?” said she
solemnly. “And do you know as you’ll be punished
h’awful?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I been punished a’ready,” said Lucy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if ye don’t do as ye ought by them as
ye’ve brought into this sinful vale, ye’ll be punished
worse,” decreed Miss Hearn.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Them above ’as done their worst by me,” said
Lucy, with a wan smile. “I don’t h’expec’ no more
from them, and they don’t need to h’expec’ no more
from me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Miss Hearn lifted her hands to heaven in silent
horror.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, now, ye know ye care for the childer,”
said the old housekeeper, from the doorway.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the kind tones the tears sprang to Lucy’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There be enough for them,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not if ye pay yer way as ye should do,” said
the post-mistress sententiously. “Folk ’as been
kind cos o’ yer misfortune, but ’tain’t in reason
they should keep it up. I’ve ’eard tell as ye ’an’t
so much as paid for the smart funeral ye thought
fit to ’ave a year ago.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A spark of anger flew to Lucy’s weary eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then it’s a lie!” she cried. “If I’d owed for
the bread I put into the children’s mouths, I’d ha’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>paid for that! And I don’t see what business it
is o’ nobody’s neither if I chose to spend my
money so as my own ’usbin’ should be nailed down
in a coffin better nor some.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She ended in a whimper, and sat shaking, the
tears slowly trickling down her cheeks. But the
post-mistress had no mercy. She was incensed at
being thus set at naught, and put no guard on her
tongue.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll ’ave them children on the parish,” she
said, “and a disgrace to ye it’ll be! Ye ’ad wits
enough and spunk enough so long as ’e was to do
for! Didn’t ye wrong ’em enough whiles ’e was
livin’ but what ye must wrong ’em worse now the
Lord ’ave mercifully delivered ye from ’im? I’m
ashamed of ye, Lucy Wood! And all for the sake
o’ a drunken blackguard as couldn’t so much as
keep ’isself to ye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy had said she would never be the woman
she was; but in a moment all her old energy
returned to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What d’ye mean?” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, if ye don’t know ye’d p’ra’ps best should,”
said the post-mistress, half ashamed yet determined
to have her say. “I mean as yer man....”</p>

<p class='c001'>But she stepped aside hurriedly, for Lucy had
risen tottering to her feet, and stood pointing to
the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get out o’ ’ere!” interrupted she fiercely, her
whole little body trembling with rage. “I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>well enough what ye mean! But if ye dare so
much as breathe a word agin my man in my ’ouse,
I’ll knock ye down them stairs.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All Miss Hearn’s elderly blood flew in a purple
flood to her face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush, for mercy’s sake, ye don’t know what
ye’re sayin’,” cried the old housekeeper in a frightened
whisper.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I do,” she said, quietly now. "Sue"—seeing
the child standing in the doorway with a
white and terrified face—“Sue, don’t be frightened,
but come ’ere. We ain’t a-goin’ to ’ave father
made light of, be we? Miss ’Earn says I ought
sooner to ha’ schooled you and ’Lizbeth than ’ave
bought yer father a decent coffin. But ye ain’t o’
that mind, I know!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child had come out on to the little terrace.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, mother,” said she valiantly, though in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lucy drew the girl to her and put her arm round
her waist.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We’ll stand up agin’ ’em when they take to
makin’ light o’ yer father, anyways,” panted she, as
she watched Miss Hearn pound down the stairs,
muttering as she went. “And I’d take it very
kindly o’ you if you’d see as the neighbours ’ears
o’ this and understands my meanin’,” she added
faintly, turning to the other old woman as she sank
exhausted back into her chair.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes, don’t you worry now,” said the latter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>sorely perplexed and scared as she tried to soothe
her. “They’ll ’ear it all fast enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sue be a good girl,” added the mother, patting
the child feebly. “I ain’t long for this world, but
so long as I’m ’ere they sha’n’t speak ill o’ my Jerry
when I’m by, and Sue’ll stand by me in that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nobody won’t do it agin,” said the old woman.
And then to the girl in an undertone: “Get ’er to
bed, dear. I’ll run and tell the doctor. I’m afeard
she might ha’ done ’erself a mischief.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she too stumped down the broken steps.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know I ’aven’t done the best for you and the
little ’uns since father went,” whimpered the mother.
“But father were allers fust, and I never couldn’t
do nothin’ when ’e weren’t by. Ye’ll forgive me
for it, Sue, and p’r’aps God will too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child did not answer for a moment. Then
she said simply:</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course father were allers fust.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And wearily the mother repeated:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, father were allers fust.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The waning of the hot midsummer day spread
its mellow sunlight and its long shadows across the
marsh-land beside the sea. The haymakers had
been busy since daybreak; men, women and
children labouring through the hot hours, when the
whole level was one scarcely varied monotony of
golden haze on soft-green meadows and pastures
that grew yellower as they neared the yellow beach;
when the sun caked the pale brown earth in the
furrows between the crops and drew faint odours
from the rush-grown banks of the dykes where the
moor-hen hid and the yellow iris bloomed; when
the blue waves sparkled, and the shots and shades
of the shallows purpled beneath the sun shining on
the sea, and brought the only sense of freshness
that came to the sun-steeped plain.</p>

<p class='c001'>But now slender amethyst clouds barred the
horizon and shed parallel shadows where the
sky and sea melted together; the long line of
white foreland to left grew clearer beneath the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>slanting rays; the sun was near to setting and the
labourers were near to their rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tom Wycombe stood beside the last waggon
upon which he had just helped to hoist the last load
of hay.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not his own land, though he had his bit up
on the hill behind the old gateway of the ancient
town. But he had given his day’s work to a
farmer, as many another neighbour had done
likewise.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was a man somewhere near fifty on its wrong
side, square and fair and rough-visaged, but the
neighbours said kind of heart though sparing
of speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>But then he was a widower, and it was said he
had never been the same man since he had become
so, saving all his words and all his gentleness for his
little mite of a motherless daughter—all the kin
that he had.</p>

<p class='c001'>As he stood now, wiping his brow with his hand,
he glanced about him as though seeking something,
and a woman guessing his mind, answered the
unasked question,</p>

<p class='c001'>“She be down by the river,” she said, “with
farmer Daring’s lad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The man looked uneasy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ain’t no one looking after ’em?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye be over timid about that child, Mr. Wycombe,”
she said. “Ye cosset ’er more than her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>mother would ha’ done. And ye didn’t ought to,
ye know. You’ll make ’er that tender and fearsome,
she won’t be fit to stand up to the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The man did not reply; he turned away to give
a last hoist to the hay as the waggon moved off.
He was used to these remarks from kindly busy-bodies,
and he never paid more than scant attention
to them, but went his own way as he listed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E be downright silly over ’er, that’s what ’e
be,” declared the woman confidentially to a girl
who had been working beside her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be ’e ’er dad?” asked the girl, who was a
stranger in the parish.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What makes ye ask that?” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” said the girl, “’e looks old to be ’er dad.
I thought ’e might be ’er gran-dad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I see,” said the woman. “No, he ain’t ’er
gran-dad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Married a bit on in life p’r’aps,” said the other,
tying the strings of her sun-bonnet and speaking
without any particular interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s it,” assented the woman, “and more fool
’e. ’E <i>would</i> ’ave a young wife, and a pretty ’un
too—and ’e turned forty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, small blame to ’im there,” laughed the
girl. “And so long as she were pleased....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She!” sneered the woman. “Why ’e was rich,
and he married nothin’ but a shrimper’s darter
down at the Harbour! ’Er face was ’er fortune if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>ever one was, for she ’adn’t a brass farthing
beside.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They had gathered their rakes and forks together,
and were making their way across a little dyke into
the road that wound across the marsh-land to the
village on the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then the little ’un be like her mother,” said
the younger woman. “She don’t favour ’er father
any way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She be more like ’er mother than she be like
Tom Wycombe, sartin sure,” laughed the woman.
“But that ain’t saying much. ’Er mother were
darker in the skin nor she be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But they say she were rare ’andsome,” said the
girl. “And now she’s dead and buried, and ’im
alone!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, died in childbed, and ’im alone this four
years and more to mind that child. That’s what
comes o’ marryin’,” said the woman, who was a
spinster.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pore soul!” murmured the girl feelingly, thinking
of her own pretty face and the pretty face that was
underground. And added with keener interest:
“But ’e doated on er, o’ course.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Doated on ’er? I b’lieve ye,” sniggered the
elder. “’E was a fool over ’er, and she knew it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s why ’e be so soft on the little ’un, you
bet,” declared the girl wisely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s as may be,” said the woman. “’E’s
mothered and fathered ’er ever since she was born,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>at any rate. And <i>that</i> set on his own way with ’er
too, ye wouldn’t believe! Won’t never take no
advice from nobody. And she’ll get the top ’and
of ’im—same as ’er mother did! See if she don’t!
’E be a downright ninny over ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The man strode past as she spoke, and Mrs.
Goodenough gave a start.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Eavesdroppers don’t never ’ear no good o’
themselves,” remarked she sententiously.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Tom Wycombe had heeded neither the first
nor the last remark.</p>

<p class='c001'>His work was done and he was hastening to his
child; he neither cared for nor noticed any one else.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sun, when it set, shed just as warm a glow
over his heart as it did over the marsh-land, though
he did not put two and two together about it.
From the village on the hill, the flaming sky that
reddened behind the solemn buttresses of the
ancient church, sent soft and palpitating reflections
over the quiet land that lay stretched below; and
the tender radiance reached to his patient spirit
also. For he too had waited through the hot hours
for this blessed eventide that lay so calm and
peaceful a touch upon the seething earth, and the
red in the west was the signal for his rest and for
his reward.</p>

<p class='c001'>He hastened towards the one thing in the world
that he loved—glad, eager, and a little anxious as
he always was when his little maid was, even a
stone’s throw, away from him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>And as he drew near to the river-bank where he
had been told that she was playing, his vague
uneasiness began to take a sort of shape. For
there was a little knot of children gathered there—and
they were not noisily fighting or playing—but
standing huddled together gazing into the
water, and two of them, who were girls, were crying,
and one, who was a boy, was stripping off his little
jacket.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wycombe dashed forward—throwing his harvesting
tools on the ground as he ran, and pulling off
his coat.</p>

<p class='c001'>The children parted as they saw him, speechless
with terror; their silence told him the truth, but he
needed no telling—he had known it was his Daisy
who was in the water.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where?” was all he said, breathless.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, under the bridge,” cried a lad, pointing.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was an awkward spot; he plunged and dived
once, without success. But the second time the
little petticoats bubbled up before his eyes: he
seized them and scrambled up the bank with her, a
little, inert mass under his arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Goodenough and the girl who was a
stranger, had come running up, and other neighbours
followed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ot blankets and ’ot water to ’er feet,” said one;
“and a drop o’ spirit in ’er inside be the thing,”
suggested another; and a third, more practical, ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>up the steep bank towards the village, saying she
would fetch the doctor and get things ready in the
cottage agin’ Mr. Wycombe carried her up.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had thrown himself upon the little body,
breathing into it with all his might, though with
little knowledge of how to effect restoration.</p>

<p class='c001'>But luckily the little one had been in the water
but a moment, and she was strong and lusty. In
a few minutes she began to stir, then to open her
eyes, and then to cry, and at that the man seized
her in his arms and pressed her to his warm heart,
and, waving the curious and sympathizing little
crowd aside, leapt to his feet and strode up the hill
with her on his neck.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was late. The afterglow had died away,
leaving no more than a warm memory in the softer
blue of the night sky, and a subtle sense of colour
that had been, in the fast darkening marsh-land
where faint vapours and floating mists were rising
upon the dykes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doctor had been and gone, the neighbours
had been cleared out ruthlessly, and Tom Wycombe
sat content once more beside the calmly sleeping
child. Her pretty rings of soft brown hair lay
curling over the white pillow, or creeping against
her rich little sunburnt face, where even now the
fresh red colour glowed so warm and healthfully.
Ruddy lips were parted by a gentle breathing, and
heavy lids with long lashes veiled eyes that even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Tom Wycombe, who was no poet, could have told
were blue in the waking as the blue sea beyond the
green marsh-land.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one said that Daisy was the prettiest child
in the village as her mother had been its handsomest
woman, in her different style.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well enough had Tom Wycombe been aware of
this latter fact, and surprised enough, too, that
Milly Moss had agreed to take him for a mate—older
than she and plain as he was—when there
were so many lads sighing around her. Twice
he had asked and twice had been refused, but
the third time she had consented, and he had
asked himself no questions of why or wherefore,
but had simply rejoiced in his luck. And she had
been a good wife: a bit quiet—as, indeed, she had
always been with him, even before marriage—but
always dutiful, and he loved her as the working
man is not always inspired to love his wife, and
did all in his power to make up to her for the one
disappointment of those happy years of wedded life—the
disappointment of childlessness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then at last a little one had come to them, and
with her coming the mother had died.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first he had scarce wished for the sight of the
child who had cost him his wife; but as that feeling
slowly faded, it gave place to just as ardent a
worship of the babe who was wife and daughter in
one to him, and he adored her blindly as he had
adored the mother, and lived for nothing else.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>She stirred now, and he sprang to her side.</p>

<p class='c001'>One dimpled brown arm was flung over the
white coverlet and the other fat hand pushed the
golden-brown curls off the forehead. Then those
blue eyes—blue as speedwells in the spring hedges—opened
wide, and when they lighted on him the
red mouth smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Dad—I be too ’ot,” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ot,” echoed he, alarmed, feeling her brow as
the most careful mother would have done. “May
be ye’ve too many bed-clothes on. Ye see, ye was
cold when we put ye to bed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he pulled the padded quilt off her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” said she, “I know, ’cos I tummled into the
river. It <i>was</i> cold. ’Oo pulled me out, Dad?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, I did, o’ course,” replied the man jealously.
“’Oo else should? But little girls mustn’t run away
from their Daddies so far another time and get
playin’ by nasty rivers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tain’t a nasty river,” said the child, “I like it.
But I won’t go tummling in no more, Dad. ’Cos
it frights ye, don’t it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It do!” agreed the man fervently.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I might ha’ been drownded dead, I might,”
added Daisy with impressiveness, though of course
without any understanding of the words which she
repeated merely as she had heard them from his
lips when enjoining caution upon her. “And then
what would my poor old Dad ha’ done, wivout ’is
little maid?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“Whativer would he?” repeated Wycombe with
a shudder, realizing the terror in quite a different
manner! And he sighed so deeply and looked so
scared that she was frightened too.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I bain’t goin’ away now, be I, Dad?” asked
she, sitting up in bed, uneasiness in the blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he smiled, and folding her in his rough
arms kissed her passionately.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, darlin’, please God ye won’t never go
away from your old Dad—not so long as ’e be
above ground,” added he, beneath his breath.</p>

<p class='c001'>She flung her little arms round his neck and
hugged him, and after a few minutes, still softly
kissing her, he said: “And now Daisy must kneel
up like a good girl and say ’er prayers ’cos she was
too cold to say ’em when she went to bed, and she’s
got to thank God for sparin’ of ’er to ’er old Dad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the little creature turned round dutifully
and knelt, in her coarse white night-dress, upon the
little white bed, with her curly head dusky in the
twilight and her innocent face—tuned to momentary
seriousness—clear against the solemn blue of
the night sky behind the window-pane, and thanked
God, as she was bid, for sparing her to her dear
Dad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then with a little laugh of satisfaction at a duty
performed, and sleep weighing the long lashes
down once more, she turned and let him tuck her
up again in the cot, and nestled down as before
into her pillow.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>He watched her till she had dropped to sleep,
and then he went out to smoke his evening pipe on
the bench beside the garden door. And as he looked
through the warm dusk across the warm plain to
the sea, he kept repeating to himself the words:
“Thank God for sparin’ ’er to ’er old Dad!” And
his rugged, emotionless face was tender and solemn
as he said them, and there were tears in his eyes,
but he brushed them hurriedly away with his
coat-sleeve as a knock sounded on the outer
door. The cottage looked to the sea, and its
pretty garden overhung the cliff above the wide
marsh-land, but one door opened on to the road
opposite the ancient Abbey Church, whence the
quavering clock was even now striking its nine
slow strokes. It was too late for a visitor, in all
conscience, and Tom Wycombe saw no reason
why he should say “Come in.” He did not say
it, but the latch was lifted nevertheless, and Mrs.
Goodenough stepped warily into the cottage.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And ’ow be our pretty little pet now?” said
she, stealing up to the cot in spite of the fact that
Wycombe stood forbiddingly in front of it, trying
to bar the way. “Why, she looks as sound as a
bell and as sweet as clover,” added she, turning
down the coverlet to peep at the child. “But ye
didn’t ought to keep ’er so ’ot, Mr. Wycombe.
’Tain’t ’olesome for children.” And she drew off
a blanket as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>A spasm of anger flew to the man’s heart.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Thank ye,” said he shortly, replacing the
covering, “but I’ll manage my own child my own
way, if <i>you</i> please. And I’ll thank you not to
interfere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Goodenough flushed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, very well,” said she. “Then it weren’t no
sort o’ good my turnin’ out at this time ’o night.
I thought as you might need a woman to make
that poultice as I ’eard the doctor order for ’er
chest if she should cough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, thank ye,” said he in the same tone. “I
can make a poultice as well as most. But Daisy
ain’t coughed once, and she don’t fancy poultices.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, and she ain’t never to ’ave nothin’ as she
don’t fancy, o’ course!” sneered the woman. “Ye’d
best bring ’er up a borned lady! She won’t never
’ave no cause to ’ide ’er ’ead and be thankful for
what she can get—no, not she, I s’pose!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know what you mean,” said the man.
“She’ll ’ave what I can give ’er so long as I be
above ground. It’d be queer if she didn’t and
she my only one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, but ye won’t be above ground for ever,
Tom Wycombe. Ye be old—and she but a mite.
And then what’ll she do? Folk may look askance
at her then as don’t now, mind ye! A pretty
piece o’ goods you’re a-makin’ of ’er to stand what
she’ll ’ave to stand!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’ll she ’ave to stand?” asked Wycombe,
suspicious, though he knew not of what.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Well, I’ve give ye warnin’s enough,” began the
busybody evasively, drawing her shawl pettishly
around her preparatory to departure; but the man
interrupted her with a muttered oath.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, warnin’s enough and to spare, thank ye,”
said he. “Daisy’s to my likin’, and I don’t care
to ’oo’s else’s she be or no! She be my child, and
I’ll bring ’er up as I please and be damned to
them as don’t approve.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Goodenough flushed. She was wont to
be thought an oracle upon all subjects connected
with children, because she had, in her youth, been
a nurse for a year or so; and she had vowed in
the village that she would make Tom Wycombe
hear reason about this brat.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had vowed it, and instead of that, she
was being sworn at for her pains; it was too
much.</p>

<p class='c001'>She flushed, and her anger bubbled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For shame on ye, then, Tom Wycombe, for a
godless ungrateful wretch!” shrieked she. “Oh,
ye’ve ’ad warnin’s enough, ’ave ye! Well, ye shall
jist ’ave this one afore I’ve done wi’ ye! She be
yer own child, be she? Just you make quite sure
o’ that afore ye swear at yer old friends, a-worritin’
as to ’ow ye shall bring ’er up!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her anger had bubbled and boiled over; it
would not go down all at once, though she was
frightened at the effect of her words.</p>

<p class='c001'>For Wycombe had turned not white but blue:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>his features twitched, his lips trembled, but no
words came from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If it weren’t as I ha’ knowed ye this twenty
year, and closed yer pore mother’s eyes for ye
fifteen year ago come Martinmas, and was with
that pore wife o’ yours in ’er trouble, I’d ha’
spoke long ago, I would,” said the woman, as
though trying to find good reason and excuse for
her hastiness. “I allers said as ye did ought to
know and you wastin’ yerself on that brat! And
them’s my feelin’s.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Tom Wycombe found his voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get o’ my ’ouse!” <a id='corr104.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='stammered, he'>stammered he,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_104.13'><ins class='correction' title='stammered, he'>stammered he,</ins></a></span> in a low sort
of growl like a dog about to spring.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I never!” retorted the woman, but she
turned a bit pale.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get o’ my ’ouse,” panted the man again, “and
don’t dare come to me with no more cowardly
lies!”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the word the flush flew back to her cheek.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lies!” shrieked she. “Ask the neighbours,
ask the ’ole parish, ask the parson if it be a lie as
this ’ere brat be Ben Forester’s!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A shudder ran through him: she noticed it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But, Lord love ye,” she said with a brutal
laugh, “<i>you</i> know well enough ’tain’t no lies! A
blind bat ye was, I know, and so terrible sot on
that woman, ye was the very one to be made a
ninny on. But the wind do blow, and when
smoke flies in yer face ye be bound to wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>where the fire be! <i>You</i> knowed they was old
sweet’earts same as others did! Why didn’t ye
see to it as they shouldn’t ’ave a chance to get
so chummy? Pore soul, she weren’t all bad-like,
p’r’aps! It were kind of agin ’er will. I was sorry
for ’er, I was, when she took to pinin’ wus ’n ever
as soon as ’e were gone to sea, and she in the
family way! Why, the little un’ was born afore
’er time, if ye mind, the very night the <i>Mary Jane</i>
went down with all ’ands. And as like that pore
lad as two peas, it were, when I first dressed it!
Why, you won’t go for to say Daisy be like you,
I reckon! Nor yet like ’er mother, seein’ as yer
wife was black-eyed as a gipsy. But there be none
so blind as them as won’t see!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Goodenough had moved towards the door
as she finished this speech, her back half turned
towards the man, who was standing by the fender.
She laughed again as she spoke the last words,
the flush of anger still on her cheek.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it paled once more as she turned to him for
a last thrust.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had stooped and had taken up the poker
that lay at his feet: his face was horrible to behold.
Wycombe had the name of a kindly man
in deed, though surly and chary of speech; everybody
said he had spoiled his wife, and was gentle
to every woman for her sake; but Mrs. Goodenough
opened his door and fled from him that night.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tom Wycombe heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>That awful peevish, maddening voice rambling
on, like cinders dropping on a wound, had nearly
driven him crazy. If she had not gone away he
would have hunted her forth with blows. He had
never beaten a woman in his life—he had never
raised his hand on a man—but he knew that he
must have fallen upon that woman now.</p>

<p class='c001'>Slowly—for he was cold and stiff though it was
a June night—he dragged himself to the door and
locked and bolted it. Then he went to the recess
in which stood the child’s cot, and drew the curtains
in front of it—curtains which he had put up with
his own hand to keep her tiny chamber sacred, and
to shield her tender little head from the night
draughts.</p>

<p class='c001'>After he had done that, he let himself drop
wearily into his old chair by the empty hearth,
and sat gazing vacantly into the dead embers.
He could not think—he was stunned; only he
felt old for the first time—very old, older than
his fifty odd years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without, the summer night had, for a short space,
dropped the whole cloak of its darkness upon the
wide plain. Unconsciously, he was glad of it: glad
that the moon was hidden behind a deep bank of
cloud that had overlapped the horizon and was
gradually creeping up the sky: glad that, as he
looked through the door, left open because of the
heat, he could scarcely make out the cabbages and
sweet-peas in his terrace garden: glad that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>darkness covered him—that the earth could not
see his misery.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sat, stupid, almost senselessly stupid, not
trying to realize his woe. But gradually the blood
flowed back to his brain, and with it the power of
thought came to him; the woman’s words, though
he had scarcely been conscious of them all at the
time, came dropping back into his recollection, and,
with the remembrance of each careless thrust, the
tide of his conviction slowly but surely gathered
strength till it flooded his reason and rushed in at
last and swamped his soul in terrible certainty.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had told the woman to get out of his house,
he had longed to kill her for what she had said—but
it was not because he had not believed her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alas! if he had not believed her perhaps he could
have done it! But from the first word that she
had spoken an awful fore-knowledge that he
should have to <i>come</i> to believe her had been borne
in upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Ben Forester, the good-looking, easy-going,
pleasant-spoken sailor-lad whom his wife had
known all her life down at the Harbour, who had
been away at sea when he had wooed her—but
who had come back—who had come back!</p>

<p class='c001'>But why, if she loved Ben, had she married him?
The answer was easy enough. She had a brute
of a drunken father, and neither kith nor kin
beside. Her only chance of escape from a life of
slavery, spiced with blows, was marriage, and—fancied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>as she had been by many—he was the
only one who had offered her that. Ben was a
rolling stone that gathered no moss, and he was
sure enough Ben had never offered her marriage.
Why, yes, she had told him the very day he asked
her last, that his was the only offer she had had!</p>

<p class='c001'>He could hear her now, aye, and see her too!
There—down on the beach, on a warm October
night with the after-glow, still a fire in the west,
casting rosy reflections over the sea, and the
harvest moon rising red behind the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why had he been so eager to get her that he
had never noticed how listless she was—how gently
anxious to withdraw from his kiss? He called it
all to mind now.... If Ben had not been away
at sea—even then ... but he would have hated
him a little sooner, that is all, and he would not
have had those five years.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was no use hating him now, he was dead.
And Milly was dead and could never tell the
truth....</p>

<p class='c001'>Never tell the truth? Why, she <i>had</i> told it!
In a flash there rose up before him the scene of
her death-bed—the moment that he had thought
till then was the bitterest that life could bring to
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye won’t ’ate ’er, Tom! Ye won’t never visit
it on <i>’er</i>, come what may! Oh, do promise me
that!” she had cried. “’Tain’t <i>’er</i> fault, no ways,
Tom!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>And he had promised, not knowing what he
promised. She had been weak, delirious, he had
thought, and he had supposed she had meant that
he was not to hate the child for being the cause of
the wife’s death.</p>

<p class='c001'>He remembered to have said in his haste that
he <i>should</i> so hate the little one, little guessing how
it might ... how it <i>might</i> come true!</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, he remembered that he had said: “I couldn’t
never forgive ’er, Milly, if ye was to die and leave
me ’cos of ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then she had said what she had said.</p>

<p class='c001'>But of course he knew now what she had meant
by her passionate prayer! And he had promised
that which he could not perform!</p>

<p class='c001'>The little one moved and moaned in her sleep.
He started instinctively towards her, the long habit
of five years compelling; then remembrance rushed
upon him and choked him, and he sat down again,
moaning himself. Ah, could it be that those idle
words of his were going to come true under this
different stress—that he was going to hate her—his
little maid whom he had reared and nursed as
a mother nurses her first-born? Had he indeed
blindly promised that which he could not perform?</p>

<p class='c001'>Remembrance rushed in upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now that the veil was lifted the past lay vivid
and hard before him, as the familiar marsh-land
would lie to-morrow morning, when the kindly
night had lifted her cloak and the whole world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>would smile, bright and garish, with never a covered
place, with never a secret, and different, different
from yesterday!</p>

<p class='c001'>It had been a good world on the whole till now,
but now he was fain to say in his haste that it had
never been good! For he remembered that Milly
had never had any happiness in it save that which
she had had apart from him; he remembered that
her sunniest days had been those when the <i>Mary
Jane</i> was in port, and she had asked leave to
walk down to the harbour to see her father; or
when Ben Forester had come up to the village—never,
as he recollected, consenting to come in to
the cottage—but certainly, oh, most certainly
wandering with <i>her</i> along the quiet lanes, or upon
the lonely downs while he was at work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why remember any more? Why torture himself
with further proof? He was quite soundly
enough convinced. He saw that he ought to have
guessed it long ago. He scarcely even blamed
them—they were dead. He blamed himself: himself
for having so often asked her to have him;
himself for not guessing; himself for having been a
fool, and for having been <i>old</i>. Yes, there had been
the mischief—he had been too old to understand,
and it was hard he had not been too old to love.</p>

<p class='c001'>His anger was slowly dying out, but with the
fire of his wrath was dying also the fire of his
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>He felt very old.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Milly had been taken from him, but Daisy had
been left, and she had made life new for him—she
had made him young. But Milly had gone from
him afresh to-day, and she had taken Daisy away
with her. There was no one left to him, and he
knew that he was too old ever to begin caring
for anything again—ever to make another clutch
at life in its fulness.</p>

<p class='c001'>His appointed days he would have to run, and
to that end he must needs work that he might eat;
but the savour of work was gone, for the savour of
life was gone—with his child.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sat there beside the dead hearth and faced it
all out, while the cool dawn crept slowly into the
sky behind the downs, first putting out the stars in
the blue-black heaven, then softly washing it with
faintest grey, then slowly streaking it and flushing
it with violet and with rose and with gold.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rising out of the plain, a red-roofed town caught
the first of the morning light, its buildings clustered
thick on a steep hill crowned by an ancient church
that was pinnacled upon its summit, its feet girdled
by the pale purple mists of the marsh which the
sun would soon pierce and disperse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many a time had he seen that crown take the
earliest wave of the morning as though it were the
first thing that the new day looked at, but he had
never noticed it before as he noticed it now, remembering
that it was in that very church he had
wed his wife; in that same town he had been wont
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to take his little maid to buy her new shoes, or the
stuff for her best frocks.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the dawn was waxing into daybreak; the
clouds had vanished with the night; the town was
reddening, the marsh was yellowing, the river was
pearling silver-white: the sun rose.</p>

<p class='c001'>The world was bright and light as he had foreseen
it: full of hope, full of work, full also of prying
curiosity and eager, cruel cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The day was here, darker for him now than
the night—and he knew that he must face it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He went to the little recess behind which was
the child’s cot and drew aside the curtains.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was sleeping still, and there was a little flush
on her cheek that would have troubled him at any
other moment. But as he looked he saw her with
fresh eyes—he saw the round face, the dimple in
the chin, the clear skin, the golden-brown curly
hair, and even the eyes that, when open, were as
veronicas in the sunshine: the skin, the eyes, the
hair, and the dimple of Ben Forester. Yes, he
saw it all now in one complete picture. His wife
had been oval-faced, ox-eyed, sallow-hued—and
he—he was but a sandy nondescript. He saw it—and
one last great wave of hate swept over his
heart. In the little person of the child he saw Ben
Forester before him, and the morning sky swam
red in his sight.</p>

<p class='c015'>Daisy awoke. Daddie had forgotten to draw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the chintz curtain that shaded the little window
opposite to her bed, and the first sunbeam shot
straight at her eyes and lifted the curtains there
and shone into the blue depths beneath.</p>

<p class='c001'>She stirred, rubbing the eyes with her chubby
fists, then she called out “Dad!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She did not generally need to call at all, but
this morning she called twice—then a third time,
lustily; then she sat up in her cot and looked
round, and seeing the room empty she began to
cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still Dad did not come to his little maid—to his
little maid who had unconsciously learnt to think
that to cry was the safe way to get everything she
wanted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The garden door stood open; the scent of the
morning dew on the earth came stealing in with
here and there a whiff from the sweet-pea hedge
beyond the path; the sun was slanting across the
threshold, and had almost reached her bed. She
slipped down and ran to the door with her feet
bare; she knew that she should get a scolding for
that, but she was frightened, and she risked it.</p>

<p class='c001'>What she saw when she got to the threshold did
not stop her tears.</p>

<p class='c001'>The June lilies were a-bloom against the grey
wall at the garden’s edge; the wall was low and
the lilies were higher—they stood white and tall
against the green marsh and the blue sea in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>In front of the lilies on the grass plot Daddie
knelt on the ground with his head bowed down on
the garden wall. She was too little to be definitely
alarmed, but she was vaguely frightened, and she
cried louder than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then as he did not immediately respond she
gathered her little night-dress about her and trotted
across the wet turf towards him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Daddie, Daddie!” cried she, shaking him, “I
wants to get up; I wants my breakfast!”</p>

<p class='c001'>A shiver ran through him; then slowly he pulled
himself up by the wall and sat on it as though he
were afraid to stand on his feet; he passed his
hand across his face and through his hair: Daisy
thought his face looked very funny.</p>

<p class='c001'>She stopped crying, but fright was still in the
blue eyes as she gazed at him with her finger in
her mouth. Instinctively she felt that something
was amiss.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Has ’oo been to bed in the garden?” she asked
in a puzzled way—“be ’oo very sleepy and
cold like me was when me tummled into the
river?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be ’oo still frightened ’cos me tummled in?
She won’t never go for to do it again. ’Cos whatever
would ’oo do wivout me?” said she, trying to
console. But he only groaned, and she was sore
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then his eyes fell on her little night-dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and on her bare, brown feet, and automatically
he said what he would have said on any other
occasion:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t ought to ha’ come out with no frock
and no shoes and stockings on,” said he. “Run in
directly, like a good girl.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He spoke in a low, dull voice; but she was
reassured at getting the expected scolding, and
stopped the whimper that she was about to start
upon afresh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ain’t ye comin’?” said she. “I want my
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, run in and get dressed, and I’ll get it for
ye,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked at him again, still a little puzzled
that he did not kiss her, that he did not hasten to
do all her bidding, but on the whole consoled, since
things seemed to be resuming their ordinary routine
of getting dressed and having breakfast.</p>

<p class='c001'>So she took her finger out of her mouth and
gathered up her night-dress again and ran back
through the morning dew.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the threshold she turned to see if he were
coming; the sun shone on her golden head and
into her blue eyes; her little robe gleamed white
in it, but on her creamy cheeks was the flush of
recent sleep: she was like the morning dew herself—and
like the spring-time.</p>

<p class='c001'>He gazed at her fascinated—but he gazed as
one who looks through a heavy mist into a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>distance; he gazed at her as though she were
already only a memory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not an hour afterwards he was leading her out
into the distance himself. No soul had been
stirring in the village as the two had passed
through the silent little street and under the old
gateway, down the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>Alone and unnoticed they took their way across
the wide marsh that glistened with the sunlight on
the mists of the night; she was prattling gaily—the
“long journey” on which he had told her they
were going, was a great treat, and so was the
wearing of her best blue frock on a week-day: but
his face was heavy, and he did not look at her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Daisy jumped along at his side; her saucy
chatter which had called many a smile to the dull
face where others rarely saw anything but gloom—woke
never a ghost of one to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she was too much excited to notice that.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be we goin’ to buy a new frock?” she cried in
high glee as they neared the town on the marsh.
“It were a good job it were the old one as I
messed when I tummled into the river, weren’t it,
Dad? And it were a good job I weren’t drownded,
weren’t it?” she added, loth to leave a subject
which she felt invested her with an additional
importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>He groaned, but she was too much pre-occupied
to hear it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We’ll ’ave a pink frock, this time, won’t we,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Dad? ’cos it were such a good job I didn’t get
drownded,” she insisted. “You said we wouldn’t
’ave blue again, and I want pink, so I will ’ave it,
won’t I?” And she kept on repeating “won’t I?”
until he was forced to reply.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he only said: “We ain’t goin’ to buy no
frocks to-day.” And as he said it he struck off
towards the lower road that skirted the base of
the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I’d rather see the shops, Daddie,” declared
she. And as he took no notice, she added fretfully:
“’Tain’t the right way to the sweet shop—no
’tain’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the first time he had ever refused her an
innocent wish; his heart tightened as he answered:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We ain’t got no time to buy sweets to-day.
We’se got a long way to go. Ye must come along
like a good girl, and maybe ye shall ’ave some
sweets another time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Does ’oo promise?” said she authoritatively.</p>

<p class='c001'>And with the tightening at his heart again, he
said: “I promise!”</p>

<p class='c001'>They struck out again on to the sun-scorched
marsh-land beyond the town. She was a sunny-souled
babe, and she was reconciled, but as the
heat began to pour down on them, she began
to flag.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where be we goin’, Daddie?” she would ask.
“To the se’side? I ain’t never been to this se’side
before. Be it a far beach?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“Yes,” he would answer, “it be a very far
beach.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then, presently: “Ain’t we goin’ to ’ave no
dinner, Dad? I’d rather go ’ome. I be tired.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Soon,” he would reply; but the complaints
multiplied.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want to go no further,” was the next.
“Daddy carry Daisy on his back!”</p>

<p class='c001'>At first he had tried to be deaf to this last
request; he had a vague feeling that he <i>dared</i> not
take her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the old habit of the past five years was upon
him still. He could not endure that the little footsteps
should lag painfully, and that the little voice
that had been so dear to him should plead in
vain.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Daddie, Daddie,” it cried, “don’t ye ’ear?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He heard, he heard well enough!</p>

<p class='c001'>A sob rose in his throat, and he turned away
that the child might not see tears on his old
cheeks. But he stooped down and lifted her on to
his back. And then he could hear her laugh for
contentment, and could feel her nestle her head
down against his, as she slowly dropped to
sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>A farmer, driving across that distant marsh-land,
met them thus. Months afterwards he told it in
the village on the hill.</p>

<p class='c015'>Two months and more had passed by: where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the plain had been at its greenest against a sea—blue
beneath the hot sun and east winds of spring—it
was golden now with the gold of the harvesting,
and brown with the seeds of many grasses
that nodded heavy heads in the western breezes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cottage on the cliff was sad and quiet.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the best part of a week after that memorable
evening when little Daisy had fallen into the river—it
had remained absolutely silent: no smoke
had ascended heavenward from its old brick
chimney, no voice, either sober or merry, had been
heard from out its latticed windows or its orchard-garden.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the dismay of the neighbours and most of
all to the maker of the whole mischief, Tom
Wycombe’s house was bolted and barred, and
when “the perlice” in the person of one man who
had overlooked the village morality for many years,
considered it its duty to scale the garden wall and
investigate the premises—it was found to be swept
and garnished, but deserted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Men had gathered outside the inn above the
old Church Square, or under the public shed that
overlooked the marsh and—between the puffs of
an evening pipe—had declared it to be their
solemn opinion that the “pore old chap had ’eard
somethin’ at last,” though who had been “so blackguardly
as tell ’im and them two dead and buried,”
they couldn’t think, and would dearly have liked
to know.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>The women whispering across the counter to
the old post-mistress, who always knew everything,
had their suspicions.</p>

<p class='c001'>They had them, and they aired them, but they
got no satisfaction. For Mrs. Goodenough herself
was too frightened to be indiscreet, and Tom
Wycombe—when he returned—kept his own
counsel. For he did return, to the relief of all,
but he returned alone—a changed and aged man—and
he kept his own counsel in solitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the kindly inquiries of timid neighbours, he
answered civilly but very curtly that “Daisy was
livin’ at the sea for the sake of ’er ’ealth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The reply eased the minds of those who had
loved the little one, but it had not deceived them.
For the child had always been perfectly strong,
and if she had not been, Wycombe would have
been less than ever likely to part from her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Less than ever likely unless something had happened
to change his blind devotion to her, and
that that something had happened, no one had
any doubt, but everybody pitifully respected his
silence and left him alone in his wretchedness.</p>

<p class='c001'>And thus the weeks wore away till the harvest
had ripened and been gathered in.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oo’d ha’ thought he’d ha been so old,” said the
neighbours, watching him totter back from the
village well, with his two pails of water hanging on
hooks from a bar of wood across his shoulders.
“’E seemed a likely man too, when ’e married the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>girl, but folk didn’t ought to wed where there’s
such a breach in years.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, ’e feels that now,” said an old man wisely.
“And yet it seems a pity ’e couldn’t ha’ kep’ the
comfort o’ the little ’un. It wern’t <i>’er</i> fault no ways,
and it do seem rough on a child too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Was that what he was beginning to think himself
also?</p>

<p class='c001'>When their backs were all turned, and they had
gone back to their work or their pleasure, to friends
or to home; when the door was safely shut behind
him and he was alone once more with the lonely,
silent plain—the distant, murmuring sea—his face
let go of that cruel hold on secrecy, he dared to
think of his pain—to tell it—to himself and to the
land that was his most familiar friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>For his pain was there, it never left him. Only
from having been a furious beast, flying at his
throat, it had become merely a constant and wearisome
companion, who would leave him no peace
even in his loneliness—a persistent aching—a
weary, weary longing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that was it: a weary, weary longing—a
longing for the little duties that used to need
fitting in to his rougher man’s work, the care of
a tender little body, the care of a sunny little soul,
the daily anxieties and the hourly joys, the rare
punishments, the frequent rewards, the mischief,
and the noise and the laughter—the endless vitality
of the day and the deep and tender rest of even.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Where were they all?</p>

<p class='c001'>To use her own little phrase—the phrase that
came back to him at every turn—“all gone—all
gone!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The words echoed through his brain most days,
but, when the bells of which the parish was so
proud pealed on Sundays, and he closed his door
and sat by his lonely hearth, instead of leading
her forth to church in her best as he had been
wont to do—then they fairly maddened him.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the first chime of seven bells would seem
to ring out other words that were almost as often
in his mind; those last appealing words of his poor
erring wife, that he so little understood at the time:
“It ain’t ’er fault no ways, Tom!” and then the
last short bell would say over and over again:
“All gone, all gone!” until he could have sworn at
it to bid it stop.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it never stopped; it went on in his head all
the time.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the long summer was at an end, and was
fading into the sad autumn, and after autumn
would come the long winter.</p>

<p class='c001'>He used to sit upon the wooden bench outside
the door into his garden and smoke his pipe when
his work was done, and watch the autumn come.</p>

<p class='c001'>He would have no woman about the house now;
he would do everything for himself—so that he
was alone,—always alone, for never a neighbour
was admitted even if one dared to intrude,—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>for the most part they all let him be. The
hollyhocks still stood tall and quiet, with their
black and crimson tufts against the grey stone of
his outer wall, and the sunflowers bowed heavy
heads to the setting sun where the white lilies had
bloomed against its rising one day in summer.</p>

<p class='c001'>He sat there every evening and remembered it,
but one evening in particular he wished the autumn
flowers away more regretfully than usual, and
wondered what he would do if the June lilies were
blooming there once more, and he had that to
fight and that to do again which he had fought
and had done that day.</p>

<p class='c001'>He always thanked his God who had numbed
his arm and his senses—thanked Him whenever
the memory of that one moment forced itself upon
him: the only moment of all the bad moments
when his hate had taken strange shape against
<i>her</i>: the awful moment when her innocent face
upon the pillow had been the face of the false
comrade who had robbed him, and when the
dawn had swum red in his sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>He thanked Him for the dew of that summer
morning that had cooled his rage and taught him,
at least, to wait; but of late when he thought of
it and brooded on his grief, another sense but that
of mere selfish regret at his loss mingled with his
weight of weary loneliness: the sense of <i>her</i> loss,
the realization of what the neighbours had remembered
but he had forgotten till now, that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“weren’t ’er fault,” and that it did seem “rough
on a child.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Rough on a child! A child! A creature who
had not desired to come into this world—who
would have, sure enough, to fight its cruel thrusts
in later life, but who might have a few years of
complete happiness—of time in which to grow
strong and beautiful and valiant.</p>

<p class='c001'>To whom could this child look to give her these
short years of happiness that were hers by right?</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked around him on the village children,
who had once been her comrades: they were sick
sometimes, they were sometimes hungry, they were
often cuffed and scolded in the haste of a moment’s
vexation, but they were all of them beloved. There
was always some one to pick them up where they
fell, to comfort them when they suffered, to bid
them play and be glad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Who was there to comfort this motherless child
now that he had forsaken her?</p>

<p class='c001'>He paid that she should be fed—that she should
be clothed; but who pitied her in her childish
troubles, who heard her prayers and gave her her
morning and evening kiss,—who loved her?</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet she, whom he had doated on and
spoiled to his heart’s delight, was she not likely to
crave love more than any of them?</p>

<p class='c001'>"Ye’ll make ’er that tender and fearsome she
won’t be fit to stand up to the world"—his enemy,
Mrs. Goodenough, had many a time said to him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>He had hated her for her warning and had
spurned it, thinking that he had plenty of time to
harden her to the world in future. But was it fair
now that he had made her tender, that he should
leave her to stand up to the world before she was
fit?</p>

<p class='c001'>The thought troubled him sore, and on this
Sabbath evening, as the cruel bells sang their cruel
tune: “It ain’t ’er fault no ways, Tom,” it troubled
him more than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>What was she doing?—who was making the day
of rest sweet to her?</p>

<p class='c001'>And instead of asking himself bitterly why God
had saved her from death that He might take her
from him after all and leave him desolate, he asked
himself why <i>he</i> had snatched her from the river
that he might forsake her in her helplessness the
very next day? And a heartbreaking picture rose
up before him of his little maid thin and sad,
hungering for love, pining for him—unconsciously
made to feel, in her childish sensitiveness, that
she was different from other children; set apart
by something that she could not understand, to be
less loved—perhaps even to be shunned, despised,
neglected! His pretty Daisy—his good little maid—who
had never done any harm!</p>

<p class='c001'>The last bell was dinning it into his ears: “All
gone—all gone!” But there was silence at last.
The folks were all safe in church, and he was alone
in the quiet evening.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Alone, but not at peace; though the land that
lay stretched below him, miles upon miles of
serene pastures, studded with browsing cattle and
brown with tender shades, might well have brought
him some measure of serenity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mechanically he thought of the words that the
parson would speak when the service was ended:
“And the peace of God which passeth all understanding.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Was it because no one could understand, that it
was never to be found? It was no use going to
church to find it—for he had tried that ... “parson”
he could not grasp, and the sight of the neighbours
and the knowledge that they guessed his grief, put
peace further from him than ever. Where was it
to be found? He did not know ... but something
within him knew, and whispered to him that it was
to be found doing the right; yes, and again—that
it was to be found in the heart of his little maid.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had known it; she had breathed it forth
from her sunny innocence; she had brought it to
him often and often. Would she not bring it
again? Was she changed because others had
sinned?</p>

<p class='c001'>A sound of distant singing came to him across
the hollyhocks and the sunflowers: it was the
evening hymn. It was kinder than the bells—it
brought him nearer to peace: <i>she</i> had been so fond
of it, so proud to raise her baby voice with the rest.
Was she singing it to-night? Was she happy?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>He lost himself in his dream of her; not that she
was not always in his thoughts, in work or in
leisure, but that when he was at leisure he could
live only in his dreams.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bitterness—or at least active anger and resentment—had
long ago died out of him; all <i>that</i> was
dead as the dead woman whom he had once loved—buried
in her grave. It was always of his little
maid that he dreamed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sun had set; the west was still glorious
behind the cottages, and even the grey downiness
of the lightly-veiled sky overhead was warm with
the memory of the borrowed flush, but the twilight
was gathering, dusky and tender: the great plain
took a sorrowful farewell of the day, lingering over
it softly: the red harvest moon crept slowly between
the sea and the sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>Vaguely he remembered that it was on just such
a night, ten years and more ago, that he had wooed
his wife down yonder by the distant harbour. Yet
it was less of her that he thought than of his maid—of
his dear little maid.</p>

<p class='c001'>He dreamed of her as he saw her that last time
framed in the doorway, with the first of the sunlight
upon her and the dew of the morning and the springtime.
And even as he dreamed—there she was!
There was a little rustle in the cabbages below the
garden wall—and there she stood with her golden
head just in front of the red moon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only it was not quite like his little maid; this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>little one was taller and thinner, and her cheeks
were not so round and had not the sweet flush that
he knew, and her eyes were bigger and had a wistful
look in them that she had never had cause to
wear. It was a vision—but it was like her—oh,
very like her as she had looked in her whiteness
and her innocence....</p>

<p class='c001'>He took his pipe from his mouth; it dropped
between his fingers on to the bench beside him; and
he sat staring at her; but he would not move for
fear the sweet figure should vanish, for fear the
joyful dream should come to an end and he should
be awake again and alone with his loneliness.</p>

<p class='c001'>But <i>she</i> moved.</p>

<p class='c001'>She swung her little arms on high as she had
been wont to do whenever she was happy; then
she ran forward—ran straight towards him across
the lawn—ran, with a cry of joy, straight to her
old place upon his bosom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he knew that it was no vision, but just
his little maid in the flesh, warm and living and
loving—his little maid come back to him. He
asked no questions; he just held her there—where
she had flown—to his heart; he just held her there
and was content.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she spoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I be come ’ome, Daddie,” she said. “Daisy
didn’t like bein’ away down there by the far beach
where there wasn’t no Daddie. And she didn’t
know whativer er old Daddie would do wivout ’is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>little maid. ’Cos when I was near drownded dead
in the river ’oo said I mustn’t niver—niver go away
from my old Dad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He clasped her a little tighter, but still he did not
speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I be very tired, Daddie,” she said in a minute.
“I be dreadful tired.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he opened his lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Owever did you get ’ere, little ’un?” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I runned,” she answered simply.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, all the way?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c001'>She nodded her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“First I runned very fast,” she said, “’cos I was
f’ightened Mrs. Low’d ’ave me and whop me. And
then I runned slower, but I runned all the time. <i>I</i>
remembered the way, I did,” said she, wisely
nodding her head again.</p>

<p class='c001'>A spasm of fury seized him, but it turned to
self-reproach, and then again, quickly, it turned to
simple thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That <i>was</i> clever of you,” said he mechanically
as he had often been wont to say when he knew
she expected praise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, that <i>was</i> clever of me,” assented she, well-contented,
“but I wanted to get ’ome quick. They
said down there I ’adn’t got no Dad, they did. But
I knew <span class='fss'>THAT</span> weren’t true, so I come. And I didn’t
stop on the way, neither—not to look at the sweets
nor nothin’—’cos I wanted my Daddie, I did!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She paused for an answer but none came—only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the arm held her a little more firmly in her
place.</p>

<p class='c001'>So she added, shaking him a little as she had
used to do: “But I wants my supper bad. I be
very hungry, I be!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pore little ’un!” murmured he, thinking of her
face that was not so plump or so rosy as it once
had been, and of her eyes that were more wistful:
“Pore mite!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we’ll go and buy sweets one day, Daddie,
won’t we?” insisted she. “’Cos you promised, ye
know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did I?” said he dreamily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course you did!” she declared. “And folk
must allers do what they promises.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again he did not reply, because, though he
heard, his heart was too full to heed. This was
why his arm had been sure that day when he had
saved her from death.</p>

<p class='c001'>But a sudden misgiving seemed to seize her at
his silence, and she cried defiantly: “’Cos I ain’t
niver goin’ away no more, Daddie. Niver no
more!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the torrent of his joy was loosed. He
pressed her convulsively to his heart and kissed
her ... kissed her for all the weary days that
were past ... for all the many hours of longing
emptiness, when he might have had her to kiss
and had not chosen to do so! Kissed her for all
the kisses that he had cheated her of.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“No, never no more!” echoed he fervently.
“Daisy sha’n’t go away from ’er old Daddie never
no more!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The moon was high up in the sky; the red had
waned in her but the gold glowed, for she was the
harvest moon. Over the dim marsh-land faint
mists were beginning to rise, like tender ghosts of
the day that was gone,—and the mystery of dusk
hovered abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Tom Wycombe sat as he had sat three months
ago, when he had given thanks to his God for
restoring his child to him from the grave.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now he understood what was the meaning
of the peace which passeth all understanding.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The moon shone fitfully into the wood; shone
fitfully because wild clouds were hurrying across
the sky at intervals, 
so that the feeble radiance could not even pierce, as it might have done, the tender shadows of the
forest that autumn gales had
not yet stripped of its golden glory.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the foot of the dell two figures stood leaning
against the gate that led from the wood on to the
undulating ground beyond.</p>

<p class='c001'>The damp, russet leaves made a carpet under
their feet, and fluttered softly down upon them as
the gusts flew past; for their heads were bare, his
cap had fallen off and bonnet she had none, and
golden curls mingled with black ones as her face
lay upon his shoulder and his rested against her
cheek.</p>

<p class='c001'>They were lovers and they were young—very
young. Any one could have told that—even in
the fitful moonlight, even in the shadow: slender
and strong and supple of pose—boy and girl still.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Oh, Charley, what ever shall I do when you’re
gone!” moaned she. “I don’t see as ’ow I can get
along anyways! It’d be bad enough for any girl,
but it’s worse for me, ye must own, ’cos I can’t
never say a word to nobody about ye. It’s as
much as my life’s worth to let it be knowed as I
wish ye a good-even. Ye don’t guess ’ow father
’ates you and yours, I’ll be bound ye don’t. I
b’lieve as ’e’d sooner see me dead than wed to ye.
Oh, Charley, <i>must</i> ye go away?”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a plaintive prophecy of tears in the
soft murmuring voice, and the lad’s tones were
nearly as rueful as he answered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t see whatever I can do else, Bess,” said
he, pressing her closer than ever to his side.
“Father won’t never give me no proper share in
the farm, I know. There’s Ben to come afore me,
and if ever he had a soft place for me, it’s pretty
nigh froze over since that row last night. That’s
what ’ave made my mind up, ye see?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell me about it, dear,” said she, lifting her
face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t see as that’ll do no good,” answered he,
kissing her face instead.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d sooner know,” she sighed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there, ’e said as if ever ’e caught me a-courtin’
of ye, ’e’d turn me out neck and crop that
very day, and never a penny of ’is should I see.
It’s real onnat’ral it is, ’ow them two old blokes keep
up that ’ere old row over a darned bit o’ land that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>was sold away a year ago. They must ’ave a real
mind to quarrel, they must. So, ye see, as ’e said
’e’d turn me out neck and crop, says I to myself,
the best way for me is to turn myself out first and
save trouble. There’ll be no bones broke that way.
For it’s sartin’ sure I ain’t goin’ to give ye up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then he kissed her again more passionately
than before.</p>

<p class='c001'>For a few minutes neither spoke; there was no
need. They were together, the world was far and
parting was near and love sang aloud with triumphant
and commanding voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>But at last she sighed and with infinite tenderness
whispered simply: “And I won’t never give
you up neither, Charley. No, not if I was to die
for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know ye won’t,” said he, “I ain’t a bit afraid,
else I wouldn’t go.” He paused a moment, looking
into her eyes. A ray of moonlight filtered through
the trees and lit her face; it made it white as the
face of death. But the lips were parted in wondering
rapture, and after a few moments he laughed a
little laugh and repeated dreamily: “No, I ain’t a
bit afraid. Ye’d never give me up.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he sighed too, and in a different tone,
striving for cheeriness, added: “And it won’t be
so bad, ye know, arter all, darlin’. I’ll be bound I
shall get on. Where there’s a will there’s a way,
they say, and there ain’t no mistake about the will,
is there? Besides, I’m a man now—twenty-one last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>March—and I’m strong, and school-master used to
say I’d got a precious good head-piece when I’d
a mind. I <i>’ave</i> got a mind now, ye see, though I
never ’ad before. I’ll soon come back and fetch
you, you bet. It ain’t so much as we shall want.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” said she eagerly, “a very little ’d do to
keep me on. I don’t eat much, and I’m very quick
at things and real hearty, though some might think
I <i>looked</i> a bit slim. Why, I could do a bit of
earnin’ too,—take in needlework or some such-like,
though I’d rather work out-doors, with you. Oh,
Charley,” cried she again entreating, “I don’t see
why we shouldn’t just be wed now, somewheres on
the quiet, and me go away with you wherever you
be bound for. It’d be much safer, and they won’t
never say ‘yes’ to us, not if we was to wait till
Doomsday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A great gust of wind swept them furiously, and
she clutched his arm and looked up at him with
bewildering pleading in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the boy turned his away and shook his head
with a superior air of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’d never do, Bess,” said he. “Ye’re too young.
Why, you ain’t seventeen yet! Ye might be fallin’
sick on my ’ands. We mightn’t ’ave enough to
eat. A man can starve a bit, but a girl can’t—not
one like you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She sighed again, it was almost a moan, and lay
her cheek against his once more. Then, suddenly,
a tremor ran through her. They were standing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>within the edge of the wood with their backs to
the open land beyond it. But in seeking his face
she had turned hers towards the sky upon which
low thorn-trees stood black, studding the rising
ground.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s that there?” she whispered terrified.</p>

<p class='c001'>A cloud was hurrying across the moon and had
laid a shadow on the whiteness of the open.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where?” he asked, turning to follow her gaze.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, there,” she repeated. “Didn’t ye see
some one a-movin’ across behind the bushes?
Charley, Charley, there’s father’s eyes everywheres—a-gleamin’
out at us all the time. Let’s get
away from ’em—do!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The lad moved forward, though still holding her
fast with one hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no,” said he reassuringly. “Ye’re a bit
excited, that’s what it is,—ye fancy things. We
should ha’ been bound to see any one move across
the open there, you take my word for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She pressed closer to his side, but she trembled
still.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I b’lieve father ’d kill me if he knowed as I’d
been with ye to-night,” she whispered. “Ye don’t
know what ’e’s like, father. It’s bad enough when
’e ’aven’t got the drink in ’im. ’E’s mad agin you
and yours—downright crazy-mad. Oh, Charley,”
she moaned again, clinging to him with trembling
hands, “take me with ye, do, now! Don’t leave
me wi’ father! I’d not be a bit o’ trouble to ye,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>that I wouldn’t! You try me. I’d rather live on
a crust for weeks than stay ’ere alone. I’m frightened,
I am. It seems as if somethin’ bad was
bound to ’appen if ye go away and leave me.
Take me along with ye, Charley!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The boy wavered. He too was frightened,
though he would not have acknowledged it. He
too, with the headlong recklessness of youth, would
have adventured all to hold what he had won, to
have what he wanted; but a vague sense of responsibility
born of this new and strangely constraining
love, an uncomprehended instinct to
protect what clung to him, prevailed at last. He
kissed her again, but it was no longer feverishly;
he was as he had said—a man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, now, there,” said he soothingly, “ye
mustn’t be onreasonable, ye know. I shouldn’t be
actin’ right by ye if I was to take ye from yer ’ome
afore I’d somethin’ to keep ye on. I ’aven’t acted
just as I should ha’ done by ye, may be, but I can
make that right. Only ye must let me go and
work for ye. If I was a ’cute un like my brother
Ben, I’d say to the Guv’nor: ‘Give me the bit o’
money what’d be mine some day, and let me go
and take my own chance wi’ it.’ But it’d be
trickin’ ’im to do that for to marry the darter o’
the man as ’e ’ates—and I ain’t a bad lot. No, I’ll
make my own way, and we’ll be man and wife, fair
and open, and please God father ’ll come to love
ye too—some day. ’Tain’t in nature as both on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>’em shouldn’t forgive when it’s done. Ay, we’ll be
man and wife come Lady Day, Bess. I swear it,
and it shall be done square. I ain’t a bad lot, dear,
and I’ll make ye a good ’usband, s’elp me God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His voice shook a little, but he lifted one hand
to the moon that was bright on them for a moment,
while he strained her wildly to his breast with the
other; and she felt the purpose in him and bowed
to the inevitable.</p>

<p class='c001'>But her tears flowed softly, and though he stroked
her cheek to dry them, they flowed still and her
body shook with her grief.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell me ye’ve faith in me, dear?” whispered he.
“Tell me ye feel as ye can trust me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She did not answer; the sobs that she strove
against would not be stilled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, Bess!” whispered he again, half frightened.
“Ye’ll never be afraid to trust me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she understood and raised her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Trust ye?” she echoed bravely, and her eyes
shone in the moonlight. “Trust ye? D’ye think
I take ye for a blackguard?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He kissed her passionately and she dried her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It ain’t that,” said she, and tried to smile. “It’s
only as Lady Day’s a long way off.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The moon had topped the tallest tree that bent
and quivered in the wind; she might have been
hurrying herself, so wildly the clouds hurried past
her, so cruelly the moments hurried onward.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“They’ll be waitin’ supper for me,” said the girl
with a little shudder, looking up at the trees.
“Father’s been to market. He was to be late
’ome, but ’e’ll ’ave been back long afore this. Oh
dear!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ye mustn’t notice ’im too much,” declared
he bravely. “’E won’t plague ye, if ye stand up
agin’ ’im. Ye must be a bit saucier. I’m sure ye
used to be saucy enough to me when first I fancied
ye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That was ’cos I knowed ye loved me,” smiled
she, and then they kissed again. But they couldn’t
keep the sauciness up, and the next thing she said
was said sadly enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s near six months to Lady Day,” she whimpered.
“And I sha’n’t ’ave no news of ye till
then!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll write when I get a bit settled,” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d never get the letter,” moaned she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye must go to the Post-office for it,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Post-mistress might tell,” objected she. But
then with a sudden inspiration: “May be Nan
Fordham ’d fetch it for me. She’s a good child.
And ye might put A. B. on it, same as the girls do
when they ’vertise for a situvation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, yes, that’s capital,” he cried. “What a
clever one you is, to be sure! Nobody’d find <i>that</i>
out, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The comfort was a little one, but they hugged it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>and planned their plan with fresh courage. But it
was parting all the time, bitter-sweet, though they
painted the future brightly for one another, and
took their fill of the kisses the memory of which
was to keep them alive: it was parting and it hurt.</p>

<p class='c001'>They made it last as long as they could;
sheltering her from the blasts with his arm around
her, he took her to the edge of the wood, and
many a time did he leave her, yet was fain to come
back for a last word, a last embrace. But it was
all over at last; he was gone, and she was left on
the empty road, swallowing her tears, alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some one stood at the house-door as she crossed
the common; the moon had sailed forth from
among the clouds again and stared at her grief,
and would not cover her sorrow. She could see
the figure plain enough in the hard, white light,
and her heart leapt to her mouth and she thanked
the chance that had made Charley run down the
grass slope to the railway-station instead of coming
round with her by the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>She knew to whom the figure belonged, and she
knew what it would say, and try as she would to
call to mind her lover’s brave banter, try as she
would to steel herself as he had bade her, her
cheek was as white as the moonlight and her heart
fell against her side.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where’ve ye been?” thundered the figure as
she came up, and the first word told her that the
man was in drink.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“Down the village,” she faltered, faintly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s a lie,” he shouted. “Why’s your feet
soppin’ wet, and what are them dead leaves a-stickin’
in yer ’air for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>She put her hand up vaguely; it was true—the
leaves of the wood had left upon her the loving
memory of her happiness. She took the two
withered witnesses from her curls and pressed them
to her bosom.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ve been down in the copse, and ye’ve been
and met a man there, ye shameless slut,” shrieked
the father, shuffling a step nearer to her and seizing
her by the arm. “Now, don’t tell me no more
darned lies. It ain’t no use. You’ve been see’d a-cuddlin’
and a-kissin’, fit to shame the mother that
bore ye. And I tell ye what, I’ve ’ad my suspicions
this fortnight past, and if this lover o’
yours—damn ’im!—’ave got aught to do with that
stuck-up good-for-nothing son of a scamp—ye
know well enough who I mean!—I’ll break every
bone in his blasted body! So now ye’re warned,
and ye know me well enough to guess I’ll do what
I say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess stood still and said not a word; she was
cold and she trembled, but a blessed peace glowed
within her, and she was not afraid, for she was
happy. The glamour of her bliss was fresh upon
her, his kisses still burned her lips, his heart
still beat against hers. She stood still, rapt and
listening—listening for the whistle of the train that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>should tell her he was being carried far from <i>her</i>
but far from harm also.</p>

<p class='c001'>It struck upward from the valley, and she sighed
a sigh of relief. For herself she could bear much—and
<i>he</i> was safe. No one could break every bone
in his blessed body now.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why don’t ye answer?” snarled the man.
“Am I to be fooled and cheeked by a mere brat, a
chit as ain’t fit to be tret as a woman at all? Am I
to be gainsayed by the likes o’ you?”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he shook her violently by the arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t gainsay ye, father,” said she, quietly.
“I ’aven’t said nothin’. I ain’t got nothin’ to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The words seemed to exasperate him to frenzy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, you won’t speak, won’t ye?” cried he.
“You ain’t goin’ to give the young blackguard
away, eh? Well, then, ye can take what I meant
for <i>’im</i> instead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And with a violent jerk he threw her from him,
kicking her even as she fell.</p>

<p class='c001'>She went down, striking the garden gate, which
in her fear she had left unlatched, and lay, huddled
together, with her head in the dust of the road, and
her face as marble under the moon.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked at her a moment, muttering curses
still, and lurched up the path again, calling fiercely
to some one within as he went.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’d best come and fetch this precious darter
o’ yours, marm,” cried he. “And ye’d better lock
her up when ye get ’er. D’ye ’ear me? Lock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>her up, I say! She’s not fit to be let out doors. I
thought she were only a chit,—but she’s a slut,
that’s what she is—a dirty slut. But <i>I’ve</i> punished
’er for it! Oh, and I’ll do it again if I find ’er at
’er tricks! That I swear! So now ye both on ye
know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A feeble, spiritless-looking woman appeared on
the threshold. She gave a little moan when she
saw what had happened, but she attempted no remonstrance,
only ran foolishly crying down the
path to where the figure lay motionless in the dust.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Bess, though stunned and bruised, was not
dead. As her mother slid an arm under her head
to raise it, she turned towards her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never mind,” she gasped, “it ain’t so bad.
Father’s been drinkin’—’e didn’t mean no ’arm.
Take me indoors, mother, or the neighbours’ll
see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Benson looked round nervously. There
was nothing she minded so much in the world as
“the neighbours seeing” anything.</p>

<p class='c001'>But luckily it was night, farm work was over,
and the farm buildings that clustered close together
opposite the house were deserted and silent: and
the village proper lay further down the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess tried to sit up, and the woman helped her;
she helped her with her arm, but word of comfort
for the young and sore spirit there was none.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whatever ye must needs go and take up with
that young Chiswick for I’m sure I don’t know,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>whimpered she. “Ain’t there trouble enough
a’ready? You did ought to ha’ knowed better—your
father so set on agin them Chiswicks as ’e is!
One’d think there weren’t no other chaps about!
But, Lor’, ye can’t count on girls!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She had her arm round the slender waist and
helped the drooping figure up the path. And in
the kitchen she set her in a chair and wiped the
blood from her forehead, and then took her up and
put her to bed. It was done deftly enough, but
all the time the same moan went on till the child
was glad when the candle was taken away and she
was left to her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c001'>For in her thoughts she could live over again
the happy moments that were so near in the past ... and
of the future she would not think. That
was grim enough, for she guessed pretty surely
that her home would give her nothing but what it
had given her to-night, and Charley was gone: gone
to some unknown spot in that vast and unknown
London, that to Bess was as the wilderness itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>She had not put it too strongly when she had
said that her fight would be a worse fight than
another’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>It <i>was</i> a bad fight, but it was a brave one. For
a while there was a lull in the persecution; either
sobriety brought shame for the brutal assault on
his daughter, or the departure of young Chiswick
from the village removed his excuse, but anyhow
Farmer Benson quieted down to sullen moroseness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>within-doors, and to bitter attacks upon his neighbour
without.</p>

<p class='c001'>Christmas came and went, and on Christmas
Day Bess wore a face so bright that her mother
looked at her wondering, and her father swore
beneath his breath in sheer perplexity.</p>

<p class='c001'>The night before a red-haired little maid had
run into the kitchen with eager eyes, and the girl’s
heart had leapt into her mouth. Luckily there had
been no one by, but Bess had snatched the child
in her arms and carried her into the orchard, kicking
and screaming at the indignity, ere she had dared
to ask her for what she carried. It was a letter,
addressed A. B., and was supposed to be for some
person unknown.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess took possession of it, in exchange for a
good scolding for instructions of secret delivery
not adhered to, and a bright penny for acid-drops.
And then she ran away into the wood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The leaves were all off the trees, and lay rotting
in the purple brushwood; a hard sky looked on a
hard and frozen land, and there was a promise of
snow in the air in place of the soughing of the wind
in the watching forest on that night when every
gust had borne a tale of love through the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Bess knew nothing of wind or weather:
Charley was beside her once more; his kisses made
her heart beat again, and her face was hot in the
frost as it lay, in her thought, against his. He was
well, he loved her, he had never looked at another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>girl, he had got work at last, and he was coming
back for her soon. And she kissed the letter as
girls do, and cried over it in her joy.</p>

<p class='c001'>That was why her face shone over the plum-pudding
as it used to do when she was a little
maid, and that was why the Christmas bells were
sweet to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Christmas went by, and New Year went
by, and the frost held unrelenting sway, and Bess
drooped. The crispness went out of her pretty
hair, and her tall young figure grew quite too slim,
and her fair, fresh skin became wan and transparent.
The mother sighed, as any mother must, but dared
make no remark, for she lived in terror of her man,
and if it was for love of one whom he had said
must not be loved that Bess grew pale,—pale she
must grow, and there was no help: Farmer Benson
never changed his mind, other folk had to change
theirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it was not only with the hunger of love
unsatisfied that Bess was growing white; her
health was strange, and a great fear was growing
in her mind. Yes, young as she was, she was too
much of a country girl not to know very well what
things meant, and an awful chill struck at her
heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>What should she do? Whither turn for help,
with whom consult, in whom confide?</p>

<p class='c001'>Her mother? She loved her mother, and would
never have dreamed of blaming her for being what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>she was; but was it wonderful that she should feel
the burthen would only weigh the heavier on herself
for endeavouring to share it with one who was
too weak to bear any part of it? Perhaps—perhaps
if she had known more of mother’s love she
would have trusted it a little, and perhaps she might
have been right; perhaps even that wavering heart
would have swelled to a sense of its greatest duty,
have yearned to protect that which it had borne.
But Bess never gave it a thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not to worry mother” had always been her
motto, it was her motto still.</p>

<p class='c001'>The one person in the world who should have
helped her, she held to be useless; the one person
in the world who would have helped her was far
away, and knew naught of her distress.</p>

<p class='c001'>For that one cherished Christmas letter was the
only one that she had had, and in that he had given
her no address to which she could have written,
even had she dared. He had said that he was
changing it, and he had said that he was coming—coming
very soon.</p>

<p class='c001'>So she waited, hoping every day that “very
soon” might mean the morrow; but her smile
grew rarer and sadder, and her eyes more wistful
and her cheek more white.</p>

<p class='c001'>One Sunday in early February, when the sun
was shining gay upon the crisp snow and icicles
hung rainbow-tinted from the cottage-eaves, Farmer
Benson strode into the farm kitchen. His wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>was busy mixing the Sunday pudding, but Bess,
contrary to her wont, was sitting listless in a chair.
She rose quickly as her father entered, but not
before he had had time to notice her attitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now what’s that puling face for, pray?” said
he sharply. “Let’s ’ave none o’ them airs and
graces ’ere. It won’t pay wi’ me, I can tell ye!
No, nor get ye a ’usband, neither!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess looked up with a new fear in her face, and
Mrs. Benson said, half-appealing: “What, Lor’,
she don’t want a ’usband yet awhile, do she, John?
She’s but a child, sure<i>ly</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Get out wi’ yer ‘<i>do she, John</i>!’” snarled the
man. “Most women’s pleased to get their darters
out o’ hand, but you’re such a lazy one ye want to
keep ’er ’angin’ round to do yer work for ye, I
suppose? But whether you want or whether <i>she</i>
wants, she’s got to ’ave one. A child she is, but if
she’s woman enough to play tricks, she’s woman
to ’ave a ’usband. And a child does as it’s bid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess gave a great start and went paler than ever,
and her father held his bleary eye fixed fast on her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, <i>she’s got to ’ave a ’usband</i>,” repeated he
doggedly, emphasizing every word, “and ’igh time
too!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What d’ye mean, father?” faltered the girl
faintly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I mean what I says,” insisted he, still watching
her. “Ye’ve got to ’ave a ’usband if ye can get
one, and one o’ my choosin’ too, and that in just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>about as jolly quick time as I can do it in! Ye’ve
got yerself talked about i’ the parish, a-prowlin’
round with a young vagabond at dead o’ night, and
I ain’t a-goin’ to ’ave no girl o’ mine talked about,
not if I knows it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s ’ard lines, that it is,” sniffed the woman
irrelevantly. “And we with on’y that one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s ’ard lines to ’ave such a slut for a darter,”
snarled the man, drawing up his bloated figure to
its awful height and turning his drink-sodden face
upon his wife. “The Bensons ’ave been respectable
folk ever sin’ I can remember, though <i>you</i> be
a bit of a fool, Mary, and I ain’t a-goin’ to ’ave ’em
blowed upon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I <i>can’t</i> get married,” faltered Bess, with a break
in her voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, can’t ye!” sneered the father. “We’ll
soon see about that, leastways if there’s a man fool
enough to take ye. And that’s where I’m comin’
to. Jim Preston, from over Harraden way, is
a-comin’ in this arternoon to ask ye to walk out
wi’ ’im. ’E’s not much to look at, but ’e can
keep a wife, and ’e saw ye over in the town one
day, and was flat enough to fancy ye. Ye’re
lucky to git the chance, and ye’d best catch ’old of
it. Leastways, if ye don’t, I’ll know the reason why.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can’t git married, father,” was all Bess said
again.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then the man went up to her with his
heavy fist raised above his head, as on the night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>when she had come home from her tryst in the
wood. She shrank against the dresser, and Mrs.
Benson murmured frightened words beneath her
breath.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he seemed to think better of it, for his arm
dropped at his side, and he turned from her with
a muttered curse.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I’ll know the reason why, so sure as my
name’s John Benson,” he repeated. “And if I
find you sittin’ pulin’ and whinin’ ’ere over that
darned scapegrace lad o’ Ben Chiswick’s—damn
’im!—I tell ye fair and square I’ll turn ye out of
’ouse and ’ome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I knowed it’d come to this,” moaned the mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come to this?” laughed he. “Ay, and it’ll
come to wus afore I’ve done if ye can’t make ’er
mind my orders, marm. Ye may think it’s tall
talk, miss,” he added, turning to his daughter again,
“but as sure as this is the Sabbath Day and there’s
a God above us, I’ll turn ye out sooner than see
ye wed to Ben Chiswick’s son. I’ll turn ye out,
be the disgrace what it may.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He brought his great fist down on the dresser
with a thud that made the plates and dishes rattle
on the rack, and turned upon his heel.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the door he faced her once more, with the
latch in his hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jim Preston ’ll be round somewheres about
three o’clock,” said he. “Ye’d best look alive
arter dinner and smarten yerself up.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>After that first shrinking from his hand, Bess
had not moved while he had been speaking. She
had not even dropped her eyes. And now that
he was gone, she just sat down again quietly, but
with a sort of slowness that told of momentarily
spent energy though not of waning courage.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll give the young man a nice welcome, leastway,
Bess,” begged the mother, half frightened
without knowing it, of this silent daughter, whose
moods and intentions were as a foreign tongue to
her. “Even if ye did fancy young Chiswick a bit,
’e’s left the place, and out o’ sight ’s out o’ mind wi
the men, they say. Very like ’e knowed it weren’t
no go, for they do say th’ old man’s as set agin
father as father’s agin ’im. I call it main reason’ble
o’ the lad to take ’isself off: most girls fancy
another lad afore the one they weds. I did myself—’andsomer
than John ’e was—but, Lor’, what’s to
be, ’ave got to be. And there’s no tellin’ ye
mightn’t take to this Preston chap once ye got
used to ’im. Anyways ye’ll speak the man civil.
I don’t know whatever I shall do wi’ father if ye
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“All right, mother,” said Bess quietly, “I’ll speak
’im civil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The winter evening fell softly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jim Preston had been and gone.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had proved to be “not much to look at;”
indeed, a stout, plain young man, with a scanty
wit, but Bess had been kinder to him than if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>had been smart, for he had paid her no court, and
for the matter of that had scarce spoken half-a-dozen
words to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now he was gone, and for a while at least
he would not come back, and she sat alone, trying
to think what she should do.</p>

<p class='c001'>The garden stretched away on the right towards
the common, but at its foot it ended in a sort of
dry water-cress moat, beyond which were pastures
where the cattle grazed in summer, but that were
now deserted and barren, staring at the barren
trees that flanked their two sides. Snow lay white
over them and clung to the broad frost-bitten
leaves of the winter cabbages in the garden; snow
was sprinkled on the privet hedge, and the skeleton
boughs of the beeches and maples that began the
wood were set clear and black upon a brilliant
frosty sunset. The sky was the softest thing to be
seen; and all unconsciously Bess kept her eyes on
the sky, and forgot the hard earth, and dreamed of
love again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her song still had the same old rhythm; there
had crept into it first one little natural womanly
moan of regret because Charley had not heeded
her presentiment—had not taken her with him, but
the burthen of it had not changed: she loved
Charley—Charley loved her; Charley would come
back, he would come back soon. It was only a
matter of waiting, of being plucky a little longer,
and all would be well yet. To be brave, to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>silent, to let matters take their course, and to wait
and to trust—that was her only instinct, and that
instinct she obeyed.</p>

<p class='c001'>So when her father came in that night from the
“Public” he found her restored to her usual simple
sweet serenity, and was appeased in his wrath; the
silly girl had thought better of it, said he to himself,
and would be safely married yet before the year
was much older.</p>

<p class='c001'>But he did not quite know his gentle daughter.
To him she was a child still; he did not guess that
in the last few months she had become a woman:
a woman strong to suffer because she loved.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lady Day drew near, Lady Day when Charley
had promised to come back and fetch her that they
might be wed. But there was no news of him; no
letter had come save that one long ago, and the
fear that had come upon Bess was a certainty, and
she knew that she could not wait much longer.</p>

<p class='c001'>March that had come in as a lion bid fair to go
out like a lamb. A sudden fit of balmy spring
weather had sprung upon the heels of the cruel
winter; the wood had a tender flush over its brown
bareness that told of tiny buds struggling forth
into the new world, a hope and a promise of green
leaves and of blossoms, of summer and the sun. A
few primroses opened pale petals to the unwonted
warmth, like the wondering eyes of little children;
a few violets in warm, moss-covered corners burst
their buds amid sheltering leaves; the almond tree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>in the garden began to look pink, and the old
thorns on the common to stud their black boughs
with the tiny white stars that first tell of a winter
that is past; the birds twittered and Bess sang, for
it was Lady Day—the spring was come and the
sun of love shone fair.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, lo! a shower struck across the world; the
sky had grown black in a moment, the geese on
the common huddled drearily together, the ducks
waddled disconsolate beside the pond, the chickens
in the yard stood under shelter, and the little newborn
lambs ran to their mothers for comfort in the
meadow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through the sheet of wet a thick, squat figure
pounded along the shining road towards the farm.
Bess could see it from the parlour window where
she was dusting the china. It was Jim Preston,
and her heart sank a little and she wished the rain
would not patter so against the window; she
noticed weather now-a-days as she never used
to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>He undid the latch of the gate and came up the
garden path.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess drew back behind the window-curtain;
somehow she hoped he would not see her, she
hoped she might not have to see him. She had
seen him several times since that day of her
father’s brutal bidding, but she had never been
frightened of him, for he got so little—so very little—“forrarder,”
but to-day a sudden instinct bade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>her beware. It was a working day and she had
not expected him.</p>

<p class='c001'>He knocked, but she did not move.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bess,” called her mother from the kitchen,
“open the door, I can’t go just now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Still she did not answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>The woman pushed open the door of communication.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t stand gapin’ there, child,” whispered she.
“Didn’t you ’ear a knock? Why, Lor’, it’s Mr.
Preston,” she added, peeping through the muslin
and seeing the broad back on the threshold. “It’s
a good job you’ve got a clean frock on. Look
sharp, I ain’t fit to be seen. I must go up-stairs
and change.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she went into the kitchen again and closed
the door softly.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no help for it; Bess opened the front
door.</p>

<p class='c001'>Preston turned round, he looked a bit shame-faced;
he had on his best, but it was wet and he
looked his worst; he put down his umbrella and
stood there fumbling with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Won’t you step in?” she said at last.</p>

<p class='c001'>He crossed the threshold, and then she saw that
he had a letter in his hand. Something in the look
of it made her heart beat. She pushed open the
door of the sitting-room and went in before him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I come across a little maid down at the foot of
the ’ill,” said he, closing the door after him, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>she asted me if I was a-comin’ up to the farm. I
don’t know how she guessed I might be, but she
said I was to give ye this ’ere letter ’cos she’d got
to go to school, and she’d come up in the arternoon
for the penny.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess held out a trembling hand and he put the
letter into it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it ain’t for you, are it?” said he, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c001'>There did not seem to be much blood in the
whole of the girl’s body before, but all there was
rushed to her face now; her eyes shone and a faint
smile flickered across her lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes,” murmured she, forgetting caution in
her joy; “it’s for me!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She did not open it, she held it in her hand
gazing at it. She knew well enough what it said—it
said that he was there, waiting for her, coming
to her, loving her: the knowledge that she had it
to read when she liked was enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re never ’vertising for a situation,” said
Preston, aghast, “and your father so well to
do!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The words recalled her to herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, no,” she said quickly. “O’ course not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Preston looked away, twirling his cap in his
hands. He did not like to ask her why her own
name was not on the letter; that would have
seemed like prying. So he was silent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Won’t ye sit down?” said Bess, in a minute.
“Father’s out, but he’ll be back soon, and mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>’ll be down in a minit. Unless ye’d like to leave a
message?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I ain’t got no message,” said he. “I seed
yer father this morning.” He paused, and then
added nervously: “If the truth’s to be known, I
come to see <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess did not answer. She was not surprised,
and it did not occur to her to pretend to be so.
She was vexed, but looking down at the letter in
her hand she was so happy that she forgot it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He woke her from that dream.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I seed yer father this morning,” he was repeating.
“He said ’e thought I’d best not wait till Sunday
come round again.” He paused once more, and
then with a blush blurted forth—“’E said as ’ow
’twas ’is opinion I was a-beatin’ about the bush too
much, and you’d sooner ’ave the thing done and
settled with off-’and.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Done and settled with,” faltered Bess quite
awake now!</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes—regardin’ me and you,” he went on more
courageously. “It’d be a good marriage. I ain’t
no beauty, nor yet much for smartness, may be.
But I can give ye a comfortable ’ome, and I ain’t
got no bad ’abits. I’d make ye a good ’usband,
s’elp me God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She put her hand to her head. The words recalled
something to her, but she was so dizzy she
could not remember what. Then it flashed across
her that Charley had used them down there in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>wood, under the falling leaves the night when he
had kissed her good-bye.</p>

<p class='c001'>She sat down, looking at her letter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve been to blame,” she said. “I oughtn’t to
ha’ let ye come at all. I ought to ha’ told ye at
the first.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What?” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked up at him with contrite eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I couldn’t wed ye,” she answered. “I couldn’t—no
ways. Ye wouldn’t wish it if ye was to
know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know they say there’s another chap,” said
Preston bluntly. “But they say ye can’t ’ave ’im
anyways, so ye might just as well ’ave me as set
and fret ’ere. Ye’d ’ave a comfortable ’ome and no
worry. I ain’t a worritin’ sort.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye wouldn’t wish it if ye was to know,” repeated
Bess softly. And then she rose and made a step
towards him. Something was on her tongue, something
inspired by his honest, stolid face. But it
was never said.</p>

<p class='c001'>A door banged in the background, a heavy step
ground the kitchen floor; her hand fell at her side
and her mouth twitched, and her father flung the
door open and stood before them.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked at them both and laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ’ave ye settled it at last, Jim?” said he.
“My word, we was spryer at catchin’ ’em o’ my
time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was silence and his face turned sour.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Well, out wi’ it, man,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Miss don’t seem to fancy me,” said the poor
fellow, driven to speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What?” roared the farmer, turning to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>His ruddy colour became purple, his eyes grew
small and wicked; travelling downward from her
face they fell upon the letter which she still
unconsciously held.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What’s that?” said he, snatching it from her.</p>

<p class='c001'>She drew in her breath with sudden dismay and
held out a trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t, ah, don’t!” she cried. “It ain’t for you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He laughed harshly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It ain’t for you, anyways,” he said, looking at
the superscription. “And as I don’t know some
one o’ the name o’ A. B. in this ’ere ’ouse, I’d best
open it and find out who <i>’tis</i> for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he tore the cover as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl tottered where she stood, and stretched
out a hand to steady herself against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='c001'>Preston had made two steps towards the door,
but a furious gesture from the farmer had been
more than he dared disobey, and he stayed where
he was, still twirling his hat in his hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old man’s face grew livid as he read; then,
with a muttered curse, he crushed the paper in his
hand and tossed it into the fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess made no effort to save her property; the
flames curled round it and swallowed it at once.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Her lips had parted as though she would have cried
out, but no sound came from them; she only leant
a little more heavily against the mantelpiece and
her face went white.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her father made a step towards her, and pushed
her into a chair.</p>

<p class='c001'>For an instant he glared at her; then slowly
putting his hands in his pockets, he turned to the
crest-fallen suitor.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye ain’t pressin’ enough, man!” laughed he
unpleasantly. “Try her again. She won’t say ye
nay. That’s on’y coyness. Oh, no, she won’t say
ye nay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And he slapped Preston loudly on the back,
laughing again, and so passed back into the
kitchen, still muttering, “Oh, no, she won’t say ye
nay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But still Farmer Benson reckoned without his
host.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess sat still, and the young man looked at her
askance from time to <a id='corr163.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='time'>time.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_163.21'><ins class='correction' title='time'>time.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>“Were the letter from t’other chap?” asked he
at last.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s a pity ’e burned it,” declared Preston
sympathetically. “P’r’aps it might ’ave told ye
somethin’ as ye wanted to know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” assented Bess, “it’s a pity ’e burned it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“D’ye think it might ha’ been to tell ye the lad
had changed ’is mind?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>She did not smile. She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” she said. “He’s a-comin’ back to fetch
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh,” said Preston, “he is, is he? Will yer father
stomach it then, d’ye think?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know,” said Bess, looking at him. “But
there’ll be some way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>No misgiving occurred to her in confiding her
secret to this new suitor; instinctively she felt he
was her best friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, yes,” said he soothingly, “p’r’aps there will.
Anyways,” he added after a minute, “I understand
as ye don’t care to give yer word to no other chap
just now. So we’ll let that be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took the door-knob in his hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I can do anything to ’elp ye, I’d be pleased,”
he said. “And if it should fall through arter all,
and ye seemed to feel ye could change yer mind,
why in course I shall allers be willin’, ye know. I
ain’t a changeable man. Ye can bear in mind that
it’d be a comfortable ’ome and no worritin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess lifted grateful eyes to his.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You wouldn’t want it if ye knew all,” she
repeated.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I ain’t a changeable man,” was his reply
once more. “And I’ll be willin’ to serve ye at any
time. Good-arternoon.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He left her and she sat still, gazing into the fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was grateful to Jim Preston—very grateful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>him; she felt that she had one more friend in the
world than she had thought to have an hour ago;
still, her perplexity and trouble were greater than
anything else could be. Jim Preston could do no
more for her than what he had done—than promise
not to renew his suit. And she sat gazing into the
flames that had swallowed her last hope.</p>

<p class='c001'>She saw her father join the young man at the
garden gate, and walk with him down the road; she
saw him stop suddenly, shaking his stick in the air,
then stride forward, striking it furiously against the
stones. She knew that what he was hearing was in
no way appeasing his wrath against her; but she
was past trembling, only she knew that she must
make up her mind at once—before he came home—as
to what she must do.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes; and there was only one thing she <i>could</i> do:
go to Charley. Somehow or other she must find
him and go to him—<i>at once</i>. And still she sat
looking into the red embers, where fluttered the
gossamer remnants of her lost letter—the letter that
would have told her what to do—where to find him
who alone could save her.</p>

<p class='c001'>A lump rose in her throat, but she choked it
down. That the letter should have come at all
showed that Charley was safe, and if he was safe
he loved her, he would protect her. Why should
she cry? Surely she could trace him somehow!</p>

<p class='c001'>She swallowed her grief and set herself to think,
seriously, practically, as she had never been wont
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>to think before. But the more she thought the
better she realized that she could not find Charley—that
she had no clue to his whereabouts—that
there was nothing, nothing to be done but to wait
till he came.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet perhaps the letter had said that he was not
coming, that he dared not show himself, or that
for some other reason it was best she should come
to him. Lady Day was past when he had promised
her to return, and perhaps that was the reason.
He had told her in that letter where to come to
him, and the letter was gone, and its secret with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>She rose, pressing her hands to her aching brow.
How dared she wait for him—even a week longer?
A week would seem little to him, guessing naught
of her trouble: but if he knew, if he only knew!...
For at any moment her secret might be discovered,
and then her father might kill her! Yes,
she believed he would kill her!</p>

<p class='c001'>Ah, she must go, she must go at once. She
must leave home, leave the village; take refuge
somewhere, in some place where she was not
known, and try to find work and invent some
means of letting Charley know.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her mother came into the room. She had her
best dress on, but her eyes were red and she had
a scared look.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What,” said she, looking round, “is he gone?
Well, ’ave ye settled it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Settled what?” replied Bess wearily.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Why, bless the girl, settled to marry Jim
Preston, to be sure,” said Mrs. Benson, peevishly.
“It ain’t no good to keep on a-beatin’ about the
bush. Ye’ll ’ave to do it sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can’t marry Mr. Preston, mother,” repeated
the poor creature in a dull voice. “I told you and
father I couldn’t. It wouldn’t be fair to <i>him</i> any
ways. I’ve told ’im so, and ’e ain’t goin’ to ask
me no more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Benson let herself flop into a chair.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll be the death o’ me, Bess,” she whimpered.
“Ain’t goin’ to ask ye no more! Lord, what’ll yer
father say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know,” said the girl. “I told Mr.
Preston he wouldn’t want to marry me if he knew
all, and he ain’t goin’ to ask me no more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Benson lifted a pair of scared eyes before
her daughter and looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whatever did ye tell ’im?” whispered she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more than that, mother,” said Bess. “But
I can’t never marry nobody but Charley Chiswick,
and if I don’t marry ’im I must bide single.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord-a-mercy, and to think we must needs
come to this!” moaned the mother. “And we allers
’olding our ’eads so ’igh in the village and fit to do
it too! Nobody won’t be able to say no more
that Mary Benson’s nasty proud! I sha’n’t dare
look folk in the face, I sha’n’t! I sha’n’t dare go
to church.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother,” said the girl, disregarding her complaint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and suddenly and desperately resolving to
make one first and last appeal to the only possible
helper she had—“mother, won’t ye ’elp me to
marry Charley Chiswick? Won’t ye?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her voice shook for the first time and she looked
up piteously.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the mother turned away her eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Elp ye to marry Charley Chiswick!” echoed
she stupidly. “Why, father’d kill me for it, ye
know ’e would, Bess! ’Ow can ye ask such a
thing and you knowing ’ow set on ’e is against
it all?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Benson fell a-crying again, and Bess turned
away with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, ’e told me I was to lock ye up if ye
’adn’t come to no understanding with Jim Preston,
’e did. ‘Mary,’ says he, ‘she ain’t fit to go out-doors,
and out-doors she don’t go till she goes as
Jim Preston’s wife.’ Ye knows as well as me what
father is. There ain’t no gainsayin’ father.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess raked the fire together. The last ashes of
her letter had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very well,” said she quietly. “Ye needn’t
trouble to lock me up, mother. I won’t come
down no more till father sends for me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She folded away the duster with which she had
been doing her work and went out of the room.
And the mother sat there only feebly crying and
listlessly listening to the young footfall as it lightly
shook the rafters of the old chamber overhead.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>The night had descended and the stars shone.
There had been a row down-stairs, and a woman’s
scream had pierced to the bedroom where Bess
sat alone in the dark. She had held her breath a
moment, but such scenes were of too frequent
occurrence for her to be deeply frightened, and
presently her mother came up carrying a candle
in her hand and bringing the bread-and-water that
was to be her only food. She was still crying, but
she did not speak, not even when the girl, with a
sudden tightening at her heart, went up to her and
threw her arms round her neck.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, mother, mother,” whispered she, “I’m real
sorry to bring all this trouble upon ye—I’m real
sorry!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She smoothed the thin, bleached hair and kissed
the wrinkled brow, and the mother cried more
copiously, and for an instant strained her daughter
to her breast, but she quickly shook her head, and,
as though afraid of herself, hastened away as she
had come, taking the light with her.</p>

<p class='c001'>And Bess sat down again and waited.</p>

<p class='c001'>The twilight was gone, the stars brightened, and
the darkness deepened. The two pine-trees that
stood over against the farm-buildings across the
road, shook their solemn heads against the inky
sky out of which the blue had been drained by the
stars.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess was glad of the stars, for they gave her
courage, but she was also glad that there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>moon, and glad too that although she could hear
the footsteps of a belated labourer echo clear along
the road, she could scarcely see his figure under
the opposite hedge.</p>

<p class='c001'>That which she had to do needed darkness to
cover it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Slowly the house grew silent: her father had been
out to the “Public,” and had come in again; she
had heard him grumbling and swearing in the
kitchen as he had grumbled and sworn so often
before; then her mother raked the fire out and
the two came up-stairs slowly and went to bed.
Presently the heavy breathing that had put her to
sleep many a night through the thin partition,
sounded again along the wall, only to-night it did
not put her to sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the night was two hours older and the
village lay dead quiet, Bess rose up and silently
bade good-bye to all that she had known in her
short, young life: good-bye to the father whom
she feared, to the mother whom she dared not
trust, good-bye to the virgin bedroom, good-bye
to all the foolish little keepsakes of childhood; and
with dry eyes, with a spirit that was too tremulous to
grieve, yet with a trust as great and a courage as
high as ever, made her modest little bundle of
clothes, and slid noiselessly down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>She dared not unlatch the door, but the kitchen-window
was low and she managed easily to drop
from it into the garden; the hens sat asleep on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>their perch, and though the dog stirred it was only
to wag his tail and lick her hand at the first whisper
of her voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>She shivered as she felt the cold night air—shivered
in spirit as well as in body, but Charley
was waiting for her, Charley would make all good
to her again, and she would not be afraid.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bend in the lane was hiding the old house
from view, and she turned and looked at it for the
last time: it was the home of her happy childhood,
before her father had become morose and savage,
before her mother had grown peevish and tearful—the
only home she had ever known, for was she not
a child still? It was cold and silent, and smiled
no good-bye to her as she left it behind—left it
wondering what home would next be hers and
when and if safely she might reach it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But beside her as she walked lay the wood—barren
now of leaves beneath the wintry sky, but
full of many and tender memories, and with the
thought of kisses upon her lips, she went gallantly
forth to the unknown.</p>

<p class='c001'>The stars shone steadily: she lifted her eyes to
them and was comforted, for they smiled on her as
the eyes of her lover. But one fell down the sky
as she looked—fell from its triumphant height,
away into the darkness below the edge of the
world. She turned another corner, and was lost in
the deeper shadow of the wood.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>A merry April day drew to its close. The buds
on the elms had burst from pink to green, the
almond-blossom was at the rosiest of its bloom, the
daffodils along the garden-walk were crowning
themselves with gold, the blue-bells began to colour
the brown earth in the graveyard of the very leaves
that had fluttered softly upon a pair of young
lovers in October last.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sun had just set, and a line of ruddy light
glowed behind the still sparsely-clad trees of that
same wood when Charley Chiswick stepped from
the train into the little station below the hill.</p>

<p class='c001'>He fancied that the porter stared at him
strangely, and that two labourers who met him on
the platform grinned as he passed, but he only
nodded to the one and passed the others by, and
running quickly down the steps, took the road to
the farm.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little red-haired maid was playing by the wayside.
He stopped and looked at her, considering.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Will you take a bit of a letter up to Benson’s
for me, little un?” said he presently.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Iss,” said she staring at him. “Will they give
me a penny for it, same as Bess used to?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Something in the turn of the phrase struck a
sudden chill to the lad’s heart, but he shirked
investigating the matter and only said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, ’ave you took letters up there before?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Iss,” repeated the child. “I carried one up,
and Bess giv me a penny. But it was school-time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>when post-mistress giv me the other, so I giv it
to Mr. Preston for ’er. And Bess didn’t giv me
no penny.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ll give ye the penny,” said Chiswick, “and
another for this ’un if ye’ll run with it. But ye
mustn’t give it to no Mr. Preston. Maybe ’e never
give it to ’er. And ye’d best bide yer chance, and
slip it into ’er ’and when nobody ain’t by.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child stared open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But Bess ain’t at ’ome,” said she. “She ’ave
goned away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His heart dropped.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gone away!” muttered he, stupidly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Iss, well-nigh upon a month ago,” said the
little one.</p>

<p class='c001'>He passed his hand across his forehead. He
had told her to wait—for that he had nearly got a
home ready for her now, and that he was surely
coming to fetch her—coming very soon. She
could never have got his letter. But if she had
gone she could only have gone to him. How was
it he had missed her? A horror came over him!
Had he ever told her where he lived in London?
A month ago! Where had she been during that
long month?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe she ’ave come ’ome agin now,” said he
feebly. “You run up and see, there’s a good little
girl. And if she ain’t there, you ask Mr. Benson if
they ’aven’t got no news of ’er. But don’t say I
sent ye, mind. Only come and tell me arterwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and you shall ’ave a whole sixpence. I’ll wait for
you in the wood—see, yonder by the gate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The child nodded and ran away pleased, and
Charley climbed the grassy slope and cut across
the common to the wood.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not till he was there that it struck him he
was standing by the very gate where he had stood
one windy night, seven months ago—with <i>her</i>. It
had been a rough night then; yet, though sad
indeed at parting, they were full of courage and
hope: the sky was blue now and the world was
full of promise, but in his breast he knew that hope
was dying.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stood there, gazing. Behind the ricks and
barns the smoke from the farm-house chimney
curled up to a cruelly placid heaven amid the
budding boughs of the elms; the sheep browsed
peacefully upon the pastures, and the little lambs
played to and fro, but Bess did not come stealing
forth and running across amongst them, joyful too,
as he had so often pictured her to himself at this
meeting. Bess did not come, and there was no
peace in his heart; he was frightened—frightened
at the awful “inevitable” that he saw marching
upon him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Presently the little maid issued forth alone, and
crept crying across the mead. It was long before
she took courage to come to him, long before he
could still her sobs enough to hear her words.</p>

<p class='c001'>Farmer had got hold of her, Farmer had sworn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>at her, and she was frightened. For when she had
asked for Bess, he had said a bad word, and had
talked very loud, and had looked very fierce, and
had made her cry. Pressed as to what he had
said, she sobbed out that he had sworn “Bess
would never come ’ome no more,” that he “didn’t
know where she was, nor didn’t care, for ’e never
wanted to see ’er no more,” and that any person,
little girl or other, who should come inquiring for
her would be treated “same as” herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The sobs had burst into a howl at the end of this
speech, but Charley stood as one dazed, gazing out
through the soft evening light upon the quiet landscape
with a mist before his eyes. He attempted
no comfort, and the child cried on, stopping sometimes
to gaze at him amazed. But at last he
seemed to shake himself, and, fetching a deep sigh,
put his hand in his pocket and gave a sixpence to
the little one, bidding her run home to tea.</p>

<p class='c001'>She needed no second persuasion, and when she
was gone he turned slowly away and went down
the hill to the station. He had made up his mind
now. If Bess had gone, she had gone to try and
find him. He must go back to London, he must
go back to every place in that vast and terrible
city where he had ever set foot. He would not let
himself remember that it was an absolutely foolish
and bootless search: it was all he could do, and he
must do it at once.</p>

<p class='c001'>But at the station they told him that there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>train for an hour and a half, and he turned into the
“Public” hard by to get something to keep up his
spirits before starting.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bar was full, for it was a Saturday, and
tongues were wagging noisily. But there was a
lull as he came in, and he was sure—yes, he was
quite sure this time—that men looked at him
curiously.</p>

<p class='c001'>He nodded carelessly to those whom he knew,
and walking up to the counter ordered his drink.</p>

<p class='c001'>A young man stood beside it: a short, thick-set
young man with flaxen hair. He didn’t know him,
and they did not speak, but a lad of about his own
age lounged up to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, Charley Chiswick, gettin’ on pretty fair
since ye left the old place?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fair young man turned round and looked at
Charley on hearing this; he noticed it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, thank ye,” said he to the questioner,
“nicely. It were a fight at first, but I’ve got my
foot well in now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“London?” inquired an old labourer laconically,
between the puffs of his pipe.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes,” replied the lad.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What trade?” asked a third.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Carpentering,” said Charley. “I’m in a good
firm now—City ways.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a pause, and then the first speaker
volunteered the information that “Farmer Benson
ain’t come to no better mind ’bout that right o’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>way, and ’ave took to drink wus nor ever,” and
that he didn’t suppose “Farmer Chiswick’d give
in neither.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I never knowed my father to give in,” said
Charley, half sadly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” agreed the other, “if old folks weren’t so
darned obstinate, there mightn’t be so much mischief
in the world as what there is! It serve ’em
right—it do!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Charley looked up quickly. There seemed somehow
to be more in this speech than it said; but
the fellow who had spoken it slunk away and
retired into the background, and again the lad felt
as though many eyes were upon him; and he
began to guess why: folk pitied him. He drank
his glass in silence, and thought he would go and
wait in the lanes till his time was up.</p>

<p class='c001'>But some one in the background wanted to have
his word too, and called out cheerily:</p>

<p class='c001'>“So now ye ’ave come back to look arter the
young ’ooman yourself, eh? I call it real ’ansome
of ye, Charley, on’y it’s a bit late.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a murmur of “Hush!” all round, but
the speaker, who seemed to have had a drop too
much, would not be silenced.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Preston ’ere’s the one to tell ye most obout <i>’er</i>,”
laughed he. “’E ’ad the last buss. That old
rascal up at the Farm’d ’ave made ’er wed ’im,
but ’e can thank ’is stars ’e’s well out o’ <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Folk surrounded the mischievous talker, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>argued with him, and Preston accosted young
Chiswick.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t ye believe a word of it,” said he in an
undertone. “Your girl wouldn’t ’ave none o’ me.
She told me so flat. And I guess that’s why she
runned away.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank ye,” said Charley huskily, holding out
his hand which the other grasped.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d never ’ave asked ’er if I’d ha’ known the
rights of it,” added the young farmer, “but I live
over t’other side o’ the county, and I hadn’t heard
no talk then. But she were true to ye, and if she’d
’ave ’ad a sight o’ that letter....”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay,” said the lad eagerly, “that was my letter ... what
of it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, t’ old villain burned it afore ’er very
eyes, and she not read a word of it,” said
Preston.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charley clutched the counter; he was dizzy.
He knew now that his last hope had vanished:
it was impossible that she should know where
to seek him in London. His head dropped
forward.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you mustn’t believe one word o’ what they
say agin ’er,” began the farmer once more, “for I’d
take my oath....”</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not finish his sentence, for the head went
up again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Say agin ’er?” repeated the lad slowly, but in
a clear voice.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Preston looked foolish, but the meddler in the
background, whom the peacemakers had not been
able to quiet, pushed up to the bar.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ’say agin ’er’” mimicked he. “And
what shouldn’t they say agin ’er? You’re well out
of it, my lad, and Preston ’ere too. She’s no
better nor she should be. Why, ’twas plain to
every eye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The boy’s face went crimson and then dead
white again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye lie,” said he in a clear voice again, looking
round steadily on the little company: “ye lie.”</p>

<p class='c001'>For a moment there was a disagreeable silence,
and in that silence there flashed suddenly into the
lover’s mind the true explanation of this awful
aspersion upon his girl.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was a father! More than ever now must he
find her. He would find her, but first of all he
would avenge her. He stood stock still, and those
who watched him wondered perhaps at the strange
variety of expression that flitted across his face.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bess was true to him, Bess was the mother of
his child ... and he waited for his adversary to
come on.</p>

<p class='c001'>For he knew well enough that the word he had
spoken would not pass unnoticed; the man to
whom he had said it was in drink, and his rage
was the quicker and the more unreasoning.</p>

<p class='c001'>But lest there should be any mistake, Charley
repeated the word.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“You lie,” he said again. “And if ye don’t like
that ye may come on.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And the man came on. The others no longer
attempted to hold him back; they only watched
to see fair play.</p>

<p class='c001'>But they did not watch long.</p>

<p class='c001'>Charley’s adversary was a little man, but he had
the strength of two ordinary men, and, if the poor
lad had known it, was the best boxer in the
county.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did not know it, but it would not have made
any difference.</p>

<p class='c001'>He staggered under the first blow, but dealt a
good one in return, and prepared for the second.
But the second threw him.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a laugh, and they looked to see this
man, who was so quick to take offence yet was so
easily beaten, get up to defend himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Charley did not get up.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a confused murmur that gradually
grew to dismay. Those nearest the door went out,
and those surrounding the boxer dragged him
quickly after them, as the landlady—summoned
by the barmaid—came hastily round to the front.</p>

<p class='c001'>She threw a scathing word at the gaping knot
of ne’er-do-wells that was left. In a moment the
place was cleared of all but one man, who knelt
with her beside the prostrate body: it was young
Preston.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shall I fetch the doctor?” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“The barmaid’s gone,” answered the woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>She did what she could for him, but she shook
her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once he opened his eyes, but his mind was gone
before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is it a boy or a girl, Bess?” he said. And
then he murmured—“Bless you—my wife!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was his last word.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the doctor ran in it was too late; Charley
Chiswick was dead. He had struck his head in
falling against the iron of the fender; and there
was another cause too—a faulty heart. It wouldn’t
even be manslaughter at the inquest.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Charley Chiswick was dead.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Jim Preston got home that night he
found a letter waiting for him. It was from the
Sister-in-charge of a London Hospital, and told
him that Bess Benson had died that morning after
prematurely giving birth to a son. The girl had
asked her to write to him and to beg him to find
Charley Chiswick, and tell him that he was a
father. After that she had sunk into unconsciousness,
and had not known that her babe had passed
away before her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jim Preston stood dazed with the letter in his
hand. He remembered how he had offered to
serve her that day when he had told her that he
should not change, though he would trouble her no
more. She had taken him at his word, she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>trusted him, unwelcome lover though he had been;
yes, she had trusted him—and him only. He was
grateful to her.</p>

<p class='c001'>He gazed at the message—the useless message
from a dead mother and a dead child to the father
who had followed them before it had reached him.
Then he put the letter in his breast-pocket and
buttoned his coat tightly across it.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Lor’, yes, ’Melia be off to the ’op-pickin’ again,
sure enough,” grumbled a shrivelled and careworn
little woman, who stood bent over an ironing-board
just inside of a poor cottage on the brow of the
hill. “Though, as I says to ’er, it’d be more
worth my while for ye to stay at ’ome to-day and
help me with this washin’, for it be more than one
pair of ’ands can do to get all them shirts ready
to go ’ome to the Priory to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, ye ought to make that girl mind ye
better, Mrs. Shaw, indeed ye ought,” declared the
neighbour to whom this feeble complaint was
addressed, and who stood poised on the threshold,
twisting the pinch of starch that she had come to
borrow in a paper, and throwing back her advice
as she prepared to descend the steps into the
road.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, it don’t seem much use talkin’ to girls
now-a-days,” moaned the mother helplessly.
“They be all so mighty sure they know all about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>it. In my time it weren’t considered respectable
for a young woman to go ’op-pickin’ all by ’erself
like that; but, Lor’, things be all changed since I
were young.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe they ain’t so much changed as you
think for, ’Liza Shaw,” nodded the neighbour—Martha
Jones by name—sententiously. “There be
some as say she be too much with the men, be
your daughter; there be some as says as she be
too fond o’ feathers and fashions and sick-like; and
there be some as can chaff her about them dark
lanes of a summer night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Shaw flushed all over her poor wrinkled,
sallow face as she put down one iron and took up
another with a trembling hand, holding it to her
cheek to test the heat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to know who they can be, then,”
said she with a note of righteous indignation in her
quivering voice. “I never did ’old with them dark
lanes, and ’Melia knows it; but when it comes to
be’aving—well, there, ’Melia may be a bit light-’earted—I
don’t say she bain’t—but she comes o’
respectable folk, and none can say contrairy to
that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, Lor’ bless you, yes; no offence, I’m sure,”
declared Martha Jones, retreating. “Girls will be
girls, so I say. But I’d make her do a bit at them
shirts to-night. ’Tis but fair to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She nodded in an offhand, friendly way as she
shambled down the rough brick steps to the road—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>matter dismissed from her mind. But the
poor widow drew many a laboured sigh from her
aching breast as the iron passed quickly or slowly
over the white linen; and when she stepped to the
threshold now and then to look to the children
playing in the road there was more than the usual
fret of work unfinished and worry to come on her
weary face, and Martha Jones’s friendly advice was
the cause.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, in the sun-steeped hop-gardens down
the hill towards the sea, ’Melia was taking her fill
of health and fun.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was very hot; beyond the waste of yellow
turf—relieved by the richer brown of nodding
grasses at seedtime, and by the green of rushes
along the sides of brackish dykes, all of which
went to form the mellow plain between the village
on the hill and the ocean in the distance—blue
waves rippled in the sunlight and the shallow water
farther out was streaked with purple shadows till a
yellow dash in the distance told of scarce covered
sands.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was a tall, powerful, dark girl, in every
particular opposite to the fragile woman over the
ironing-board. Some strain of gipsy blood in the
unknown past must have bred those deep, dark
eyes and kindled the quick flash that pride, anger,
or pleasure would stir in their brown softness.
And in her gait, too, and in her movements there
was a fulness and a freedom foreign to the less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>well-developed persons of most of her companions.
Was it any wonder that the lads liked her, that her
merry spirit and her hearty ways kept them good-tempered
and civil, when a gloomy face would
sour the best of them—that ’Melia Shaw was a
favourite with every male creature, and not quite
so popular with her own sex?</p>

<p class='c001'>But for that, truth to tell, she seemed to care but
little. She was hail-fellow-well-met with everybody—girl
and boy alike; but if anybody presumed
to “cheek” her, or to interfere with what
she considered it right and proper to do, that
person repented of his or her indiscretion in a very
short space of time.</p>

<p class='c001'>And to-day some one had ventured to interfere
with ’Melia, and was “catching it hot” in return.
The imprudent person was a hard-featured woman
of about forty, who was cordially hated in the field
because she never looked up from her work, but
picked more poles in an hour than anybody else to
right or left of her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t get much out o’ the lads yerself
seemingly when <i>you</i> was young, Miss Crutch,” the
girl was retorting with a merry toss of her black
head. “Maybe we young ’uns know a way worth
two o’ that now-a-days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And there was a roar of laughter in the field
at her words, for Miss Crutch was a single
woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yer pore mother wouldn’t be pleased to ’ear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>ye speak so, anyway,” remarked the spinster
severely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You leave my mother alone,” retorted ’Melia,
with one of those quick flashes from her bright
eyes. “<i>She</i> knowed her way about, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Another laugh around, but Miss Crutch said
sourly, “Ay, pore soul, much of a way <i>she</i> cut out
for herself! A widder in the prime o’ life wi’
a pack of ungrateful children to moil and slave
for. No wonder she be broke and old afore her
time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who says as they be ungrateful?” said ’Melia.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Them as sees the oldest on ’em racin’ round to
please ’erself instead of ’elpin’ her,” retorted the
old maid.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, she don’t want <i>your</i> ’elp to mind ’em
anyway,” giggled the girl, turning to empty her
pocketful of hops into the bin and meeting as she
did so the grave eyes of a thick-set man of quiet
aspect who was lifting fresh poles for the pickers.</p>

<p class='c001'>She lowered her own that were not in the habit
of falling before any one’s gaze, and her laugh was
less confident as she added: “There’s earnin’ as
well as elpin’, ye see.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, I say, ’ow much o’ your earnin’s gone ’ome,
eh, ’Melia?” sneered a fat girl hard by; but her
mouth was stopped by a young fellow who brushed
past her quickly, and, stooping over ’Melia, pulled
a hop-pole out of the ground for her that was
trying even her strength, and laid it across for her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>ready to pick. The elder man, who was going on
steadily with his own work, smiled a little, and the
girl who had spoken cried out, “Lor! it ain’t every
one of us gets <i>that</i> done for us!”</p>

<p class='c001'>’Melia looked a little conscious as she said, "Ye
’adn’t no call to do it, thank ye, Mr. Farr. Mr.
Wilkins ’ere"—nodding towards the other man—“lays
’em ready for us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But she looked pleased as any other girl would
have looked, and blushed a bit under her brown
skin at something the fellow said to her in an
undertone. The girls around sniggered and
whispered together, but the next minute ’Melia
threw her jokes and laughter around her in just
the same wholesale and indiscriminate manner
as usual, and the lads took heart of grace again
and gathered round her—each confident that he
could oust the stranger from her favour—and she
was, as always, the centre of life and fun and
banter. Only he whom she had called Mr. Wilkins
held aloof, and went on steadily with his work
without paying her any attention, without even
laying the poles as near to her hand as he did to
that of many another girl, and she—strange to say—never
flung him even one of her lightly casual
words, never appealed to him for his opinion, as
she laughingly did to so many others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A good ’usband?” she was saying now with
her merriest manner. “Well, now, I wonder what
sort that’d be? Some tell ye one thing and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>another, till ye don’t know what to believe, ’pon
my word ye don’t. ’Ere be Johnnie says he’ll give
me every blessed thing I can want; but, Lor’ bless
me, ’ow can I tell what I shall want? A proper
man ’d find out for ye, and give it ye into the
bargain!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The laugh went round louder than ever at this,
and Johnnie declared he would find out fast enough;
but he was told that as he had never made a good
shot at her tastes yet she wasn’t likely to have any
confidence in him for the future, and Johnnie,
crestfallen, fell into the rear.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” continued she, “there be some as’ll tell ye
a woman be happiest when the man leads her a
devil’s life; but there, I say it be according to taste
again, and ’ow am I to know till I’ve tried? No,
no, there be many a lad’s good for a day’s larking
that’d never do to settle down with! So ye may
all take it I mean to lark around a bit more yet
awhile, and there be no tellin’ at all who I shall
take in the end.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wouldn’t wait too long, ’Melia. Ye mightn’t
get asked so often as you might think for,” sneered
the fat girl again; and ’Melia—ready, as usual—said
that of course there was that danger to fear,
but that she would take her chance all the same.
And at that the lads laughed so vexatiously loud
that the girls were vexed and bit their lips. By
all of which it is to be surmised that, fond as
’Melia was of frolic and flattery, she had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>even given the smallest portion of herself away,
thus far, and, as her poor mother had proudly said
of her, was no more than a bit light-hearted. Only
to-day, for the first time, she had not been quite
honest with herself, and if she had chosen to confess
it, <i>did</i> know who she would take in the end—provided
he asked her!</p>

<p class='c001'>But there was the rub. He had not yet asked
her. There had been larking enough, but nothing
serious; and though you might possibly know how
far you dared go with a lad of your own village
whom you had known all your life, you did not
feel quite so sure with a London chap, for the ways
of London chaps were cruel and uncertain, and
everybody said you must needs beware of them if
you did not want to be led astray; and, though
’Melia wanted as much fun as she could get, she
had no intention of being led astray.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, if the truth were known, ’Melia was rather
cross with herself than otherwise that it should
just happen to be this London chap who had
made her feel something that she had never somehow
felt for any lad before. She didn’t recognize
it to herself as love, and she had scorned to acknowledge
it at first, but she knew very well now
in the depths of her heart that it was stronger
than her will, and that she would take that Mr.
Farr fast enough if he were to ask her. What was
it in him that was making a fool of her? There
was many a better-looking man among her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>acquaintance, and he had not even any of the dash
that one was wont to expect in one bred in the
great world; while as for his condition in life, it
was absolutely dark to her, and she had always
supposed she would not sell her universally
acknowledged charms but to a high bidder.</p>

<p class='c001'>So ’Melia was ashamed of herself when—as the
hoppers wandered up the hill again that day at
the sunsetting—she found herself loitering behind
with the chap from London, and actually consenting
to a tryst that very night under the lea of the
down beneath the windmill—a moonlight tryst
with a stranger, a thing that she had never done
in her life before—gadabout as she too truly was,
though not in the sense in which the neighbours
hinted it. Yes, ’Melia was ashamed of herself, but
she was going to do it all the same! So, of course,
she was none the better pleased when Mr. Wilkins—meeting
her on the meadow’s brow after she
had parted from her new swain—said, speaking to
her for the first time that day, “’Melia Shaw, there’s
Miss Crutch waitin’ for ye round by the oast-house.
She’s got a word to say to ye afore ye goes home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He spoke very seriously, looking her straight in
the eyes as he had done once before that day in
the hop-field. There was nothing to take offence
at either in the words or the look; yet ’Melia fired
up. Her conscience was sore, and it did her good
to fly out at somebody, and so she made sure that
the “word” that was going to be said was a word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of warning about that which she knew she was
doing amiss.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I haven’t got nothing to say to Miss Crutch,”
cried she quickly. “She be a nasty old backbitin’
crosspatch, and I ain’t a-goin’ to take nothin’ from
<i>’er</i>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Still the man looked at her quietly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you know what ’tis she ’ave got to say to
ye?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I can make a good guess at it,” said she, with
a toss of her head and a short laugh. “Miss Crutch
never got no courtin’ ’erself, and she don’t like them
as do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“There be courtin’ and courtin’,” began Wilkins
in a low voice, “and there’s a time for everythin’
...” but she interrupted him passionately.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There be folks as thinks a girl must needs be
a born fool if she thinks fit to take her own way,”
cried she fiercely, but there was a quiver as of tears
in her voice. “But, Lor’ bless me, it be yourself
ye’ve got to choose for, and ye must choose your
own—come what may.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ay, that may be,” echoed the man, and she
was far too preoccupied to note the wistful way in
which he said it. “But young maids can’t allers
be ’spected to know all the ways o’ this wicked
world. We’ve knowed ye a little ’un, ye see, and
we don’t want ye to come to no ’arm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Arm!” exclaimed ’Melia impetuously, firing
up at once; but he stopped her.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“Well, anyways,” he said quietly, “ye won’t be
thinkin’ o’ courtin’ just now? ’Tain’t about that
as Miss Crutch was wantin’ to speak with ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What then?” answered she moodily, as was
not her wont.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe ye had best go up and see,” said he.
But as she still stood still, with ruffled brow,
uneasily twisting a piece of grass round her fingers,
and as though meditating further speech, he added
gently, “Yer mother be sick.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The change was instantaneous. She did not say
a word, but she flashed a quick, frightened look at
him, and turned on her heel and fled. He looked
after her pitifully as her tall figure flitted down the
lane beside the wind-twisted pine-trees, behind
whose red trunks the sun was setting in a sea of
crimson beyond the purple downs. He watched
to see if she would look for Miss Crutch, but she
passed the oast-house by on her right, and ran
straight on down the lane till she came to the
turning that led to her home.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The moonlight fell into that lane the same night
as the clock of the old Abbey struck its nine
wavering strokes, fell so full upon it that the shadow
of the pines lay hard and black upon its whiteness,
and that the figure of a man sauntering leisurely
along between its low stone walls was conspicuous
as in broad daylight. He had come up from the
camp in the marsh-land below, where the fires of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>those “hoppers” who were not villagers burned
brightly in the still night; he left the oast-houses
on his left, and before he came to the farm on the
right he vaulted the low paling and made off
across the down to the windmill. He was not an
inhabitant or he would have known that that was
not the shortest way from the plain to his destination.
And there—on the slopes under the great
spreading arms of the mill, with the dykes wandering
rippleless across the plain below, like winding
streams of molten metal in the moonlight—this
man waited awhile patiently. He was not used to
waiting, and the scene before him engrossed him
but little, so that when the ashes of his pipe had
burned themselves out and the moon was riding
high in the heavens, he grew weary of the tryst,
and slowly but surely incensed against the girl who
had broken it. He was no beauty—many even
said that he was an ugly chap—but he knew that
he always got his way with women, and not infrequently
even with men, and he never troubled
himself to wonder why, and would have been very
much surprised if he had been told that it was
because folk were in a certain sense afraid of him—afraid
not of his strength, but of his selfishness—of
the selfishness that always managed to take that
for which it had no intention of paying.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the first time he remembered being
baulked of what he had intended to get, and his
fury grew as the minutes sped past. He ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>out a fierce oath from between the white teeth that
were the most conspicuous thing in his face, and
turned back across the down. The “public” lay
but a little way down the road to the village. He
could soon forget ’Melia Shaw, and she should
repent bitterly of her folly.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was ’Melia repenting already, and was it really
of her folly that she was repenting—of the folly of
her wild and misguided craving? Or was she
mourning the broken tryst that it was now too
late to keep?</p>

<p class='c001'>Who can tell? Anyway, a duty had fallen
across her path, so plain and strong that she saw
nothing else for the moment; for on the bed in the
corner of the little cottage on the brow of the hill
Widow Shaw lay motionless, speechless—struck
down in the midst of her work—the soul only alive
still, and eager as it looked forth, piteous and
beseeching, from the weary grey eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It be them shirts she be frettin’ over,” said the
neighbour, Martha Jones, standing at the foot of
the bed as ’Melia rushed in, white and scared.
“Ye didn’t ought to have left her to do it all. But
it be jest like what ye be always after.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Miss Crutch in the doorway, throwing a
scornful glance at the girl, tossed her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shirts,” echoed she with a laugh, “shirts,
indeed! A pore mother ’ave got somethin’ wuss
nor shirts to think about when she knows her
daughter’s a-carryin’ on with good-for-nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>chaps as ’aven’t the fear o’ God so much as in
their backbone. No wonder the Lord ’ave
stricken ’er!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hush, now, do there!” cried a kindlier woman
who had risen from beside the bed, “ye’ll drive
the poor lass crazy. The doctor says as she’ll get
over it this time, dear,” added she to ’Melia, “but
she ’ave got to be kep’ quiet, and he’ll call again
presently.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl had thrown herself on the bed, the
younger children, who were standing huddled
together in a corner, clinging on to her skirts. At
the words she leapt to her feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be kep’ quiet!” echoed she fiercely. “Then
clear out o’ ’ere all of yer, if you please. I’ll see
as she be kep’ quiet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The women quailed before her and made for the
door, grumbling; all but she who had spoken last,
on whose arm ’Melia laid a detaining hand. Then
she threw herself once more on the bed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord! to think they must needs prate like that
just now!” moaned she. “And there ain’t no
truth in it neither. No, mother, no, I ain’t a-carryin’
on with no chap, I ain’t. And I’m sorry I didn’t
do the shirts for ye, I am. But they’ll all go ’ome
to-night, same as if you was well—I swear they will,
mother! Oh, Lord! she won’t speak to me—not a
word! Whatever is it? Whatever shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c001'>No, the mother could not speak, but the tired
eyes grew quiet and drooped presently in sleep,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and there were tears in the black eyes of the
daughter as she gazed on her; and the neighbour,
busying herself now about the supper and the
children, cried as she answered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She <i>can’t</i> speak to ye, ’Melia,” said she. “She’s
’ad a stroke. But she won’t die this time. They
often lives years arter the first, only they can’t
never do no work again. Ye’ll ’ave to work for
the lot. It’s ’ard on ye, dear, but ye’ve ’ad yer turn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And as she sat through the silent night, watching
tenderly over the mother whom she had neglected,
and who had so bravely toiled for her, and so
proudly defended her, ’Melia looked her future
quietly in the face.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes; she would have to work for the lot. There
would be no more larking. Would there be no
more love-making either? Would she never find
that out which she had not even desired to know
till of late, which she had been so nearly finding
out to-night? The sound, common-sense of her
present nature told her that it was more than likely.
How many men would care to saddle themselves
with a bed-ridden mother and a parcel of brats?</p>

<p class='c001'>Was ’Melia repenting as he had said she should
repent—repenting that broken tryst that she knew
in her heart she should never, never keep? All
her life she had always had what she wanted. But
she had never wanted anything as she wanted the
love of this one man, who was a stranger to her,
and who was even now tramping away from her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>miles away already along the dusty road that led
to the nearest town.</p>

<p class='c015'>Every year when the harvest moon drew near
the hoppers gathered into the camp beneath the
hill, and made their fires beside the straw huts in
the hollow, and every year the picking went on
busily in the fields; but there were some folk who
said that there never was such a merry “hopping”
as there had been that year—for ’Melia never got
time to go back to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>She worked hard to keep the laundry work
together, and she did it, though there were folk
enough that said she would never succeed. One
by one the children grew up, and were put to
service or to a trade, and at last the mother was
laid to rest in the graveyard, and ’Melia was left
with only one of her brood at her heels.</p>

<p class='c001'>It had been a hard fight, and save for one hand
that had often been stretched out for her in the
dark and unknown to herself—she had fought it
unaided.</p>

<p class='c001'>There had been no time, as she had guessed, for
larking, or trysting, or love-making. And it was
in a very quiet spirit that one autumn Sabbath,
when the hops were all in, ’Melia Shaw walked
to church with a middle-aged man named Bill
Wilkins, and said a gentle and quite untremulous
“Yes” to the old question that is for ever being
asked and answered in so many and varied moods.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“’Ave you ’eard as Widow Collins’ lad be down
from London, Mr. Barfield?” said a little spare
woman who stood willingly patient before the
counter of a small shop and watched the grocer’s
deft fingers pack up a neighbour’s tea and sugar
before attending to her own demands.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was dark, for it was eventide, and the shop did
not face the sunset that was going on brilliantly
behind the pines at the top of the village street;
but any one could have told from the tone of the
voice that there was something more than common
about Widow Collins’ lad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Barfield lit an odoriferous paraffin lamp and
hung it to a hook on the low ceiling, amid a
wonderful collection of boots and hats and sunshades,
of kettles and coils of rope and saucepans—and
of Spanish onions on strings.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, he that’s clerk in the London Post
Office?” asked the other customer with sudden
interest.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“I never ’eard as she had no other, Mrs.
Neave,” answered the first speaker half crossly,
for she was not pleased that the grocer should give
more attention to business than to her news;
“and I s’pose its ’cause he’s the only one that
she see’d fit to bring ’im up above ’is station.” The
lamp lit up a thin, pinched face that had once been
pretty with that frail, trivial prettiness that seems
so strangely ill-fitted for the hard life of daily
labour, where it is nevertheless so common. Mrs.
Cave drew her ill-fitting little black jacket around
her with an irritability of gesture that told in itself
how perpetual struggles and over-fatigue had
wrought on her. She had had no chance of bringing
up any one of <i>her</i> seven boys above his station,
for laundry work only brought in a fair pittance
in the summer time, when the place was full of
visitors, and Widow Collins had the monopoly of
the all-the-year-round families.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, it’s a sad mistake to bring ’em up above
their stations,” said Mrs. Neave piously, as she
gathered up her purchases. “We’re sure to be
punished for it in the long run, as Mrs. Collins
is bound to be one o’ these days.” Mrs. Neave,
being a plumber’s wife, considered herself just
a cut above laundresses, and patronized them
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, how’s that?” asked Mr. Barfield, quite
interested now, though he ran busily round to the
other side of the shop at the same time to fetch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>a skein of yarn from his haberdashery counter for
Mrs. Cave; “I thought the lad was doin’ well,
though to be sure pride is sure to ’ave a fall.”
As the prop and stay of the Dissenting Chapel
round the corner, Mr. Barfield often felt it his duty
to add a pinch of righteousness to his customers’
purchases to make up the weight, and Mrs. Neave,
being the wife of a fellow-warden, required special
attention in this particular.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Mrs. Cave tossed her head; though she
was no warden’s wife she needed no one to tell
her how old Mrs. Collins was being punished, for,
secretive as was that absent lady, the little laundress
would have wormed the heart out of a stone.
Manners, however, forbade that she should take
the word out of a neighbour’s mouth, so she held
her peace, though it was pain and grief to her, and
let the plumber’s wife take up the tale again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, the lad have married a woman with
money, to be sure,” continued that lady, sadly,
almost as though she were grieved to have to allow
the fact, "but they do say"—and from the tone of
the voice it was to be supposed that Mrs. Neave
knew of circumstances that would have mitigated
the joys of that match, but she was not permitted
to make them known.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grocer himself interrupted her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I did ’ear,” he said quickly, almost betraying
a certain satisfaction of his own at being able to add
his mite to the gossip, “in the fish-trade.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“I know nothin’ about that,” began Mrs. Neave
again, feebly peevish, but at this open avowal of
incompetence Mrs. Cave could keep peace no
longer. It was more than flesh and blood could
stand, and she burst in scornfully.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fish-trade, indeed,” cried she. “Why, it’s a
restaur<i>ant</i>, and a smart one too, in some part o’
London they calls ’Igh ’Olborn. But though he
did catch her with that ’andsome, softy face o’ his,
she be that sort of a person she won’t look at ’is
poor relations, and won’t so much as let ’im ask ’is
own mother to ’is own ’ouse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave looked triumphantly round for her
effect, and she got it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The plumber’s wife <a id='corr206.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ejaculated'>ejaculated,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_206.15'><ins class='correction' title='ejaculated'>ejaculated,</ins></a></span> “Well, I never!”
and was speechless, though whether her emotion
resulted from horror at the younger Mrs. Collins’
arrogance, or from astonishment at Mrs. Cave’s
audacity in taking the speech from off her very
tongue was not clear; and Mr. Barfield made
a strange little noise with his lips indicative of
amazement and dismay, not unmixed with religious
disapproval.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I should say it was more nor a year since
he was even here to see her last,” said he sententiously.
“And well I remember it must be fifteen
year since she’s been alone to slave and toil for that
boy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fifteen? Why, it be twenty,” cried the laundress.
“And many’s the time I could swear she went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>without ’er dinner so as ’e should be schooled better
than others. And shabby she’ll go to her dyin’
day—though one’d think she might take a bit of
’elp from ’im now as ’e’s got others to keep ’im, and
she not so much as the bit o’ comfort o’ seein’ ’im
now and again. But it be all ’er pride—it be pride
as has kep’ ’er up all these years. Pride to ’ave ’im
better than ’erself. And this is ’ow she’s served.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was an honest ring in Mrs. Cave’s indignation,
and who was to tell—certainly not
herself—that there was a spice of satisfaction in it
as well?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor soul!” murmured Mrs. Neave. “Though
it do serve ’er right for settin’ up her horn as
she do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there,” declared the grocer, returning to
his usual cheeriness, “she’s got the satisfaction o’
seein’ him a gentleman. I suppose ’e’ll scarce pass
the word to his old acquaintance as equals when
’e walks to church with ’er to-morrow mornin’.
That ought to be a reward to any woman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She’ll look us all in the face and no mistake to-morrow,”
said Mrs. Cave, moving to the door, but
even as she did so, envy and satisfaction were both
merged in wonder pure and simple as she beheld
striding down the village street in the dusk, the
figure of a tall young man, bearing a large wicker
basket under his arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I’m blest,” cried she, gasping, “if that
ain’t—but, no, it never can be Johnnie Collins!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Mrs. Neave was at her side in a moment, and
Mr. Barfield sidled quickly from behind his counter
and stood beside the two women at the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I never!” ejaculated Mrs. Neave again.
“Why, he’s carrying his mother’s linen ’ome same
as he used to do before he went to London!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Barfield whistled, and they all three stood
staring commiseratingly at the handsome youth,
who quite unconcernedly swung along the road and
disappeared down a bye-lane at the corner. “Well,
I wouldn’t ha’ believed it not if you’d ha’ told
me!” murmured Mrs. Cave. And at the same
time, her eyes wandering to Mr. Barfield’s face,
went past him down the hill, and saw Widow
Collins herself toiling a little painfully up towards
the shop from the sea. “Hush!” she whispered,
dragging Mrs. Neave within again, “’ere she comes,
I do declare!”</p>

<p class='c001'>They all stood waiting, and the widow came on
slowly, looking neither to right nor to left. She
passed the shop, at first noting none of them, but
then turned back and, merely giving a casual nod
to Mrs. Neave as she brushed by her, walked
straight in and up to the counter, whither Mr.
Barfield had quickly retreated.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A pound of Dutch cheese,” said she shortly,
without preliminary greeting of any sort. “A nice
fresh cut, please.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked at the cheese and not at Mr. Barfield.
She was a hard-featured woman—thin and tall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>with sad keen eyes, wherein there was no gleam of
the cheerfulness that some might have expected to
see there because of that unwonted presence in her
lonely home yonder.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ’ear you’ve your son ’ome, Mrs. Collins,” said
Mr. Barfield, pleasantly, paring off the outer rind of
the cheese as he spoke, for he knew the customers
that he was forced to humour. “Married, ain’t he?
Wife with him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” answered the woman, shortly. “His wife
is visitin’ her own folk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave glanced at Mrs. Neave as who should
say, “I told you so,” but the latter took it as a hint
to proceed, and said quickly to the widow:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, but you’ll be goin’ up to London presently.
That’ll be nicer for you than ’avin’ visitors at ’ome.
She’s a well-to-do woman, ain’t she, your son’s wife?
So she’ll ’ave time to leave her work a bit to show
ye round the place.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, she’s a rich woman,” answered the widow,
looking the speaker in the face with that quiet
self-satisfaction that was the special annoyance of
the female portion of the village. “But if she ’ave
got time to leave ’er work, I ’aven’t got time to
leave mine. I’ve my customers to think of.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether Mrs. Cave saw a covert taunt in this
remark or not, it seemed somehow to goad her into
speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, anyways you must be rare and pleased
to see your son just the same simple lad as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>’e always was, now ’e could play the gentleman if
he liked,” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remark should have seemed innocent enough,
and what most mothers would have flushed with
pride to hear, but Mrs. Cave was clever, and knew
her prey.</p>

<p class='c001'>The widow glanced at her sharply, uneasily, and
laid her money down on the counter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look alive, Mr. Barfield, please,” said she,
“I’m late to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The slight was too great to be borne. Mrs.
Cave moved to the doorway.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, you don’t need to ’urry,” said she, tartly.
“’E be only just gone round the corner to the
Parsonage with your basket o’ linen. ’E won’t be
back just yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A faint tremor ran through Mrs. Collins’ body
even to the hand that she stretched out to take her
parcel, but she said nothing, and to any observer
less keen than the rival laundress, the tremor was
but a shiver that was easily accounted for by the
sea-fog that was slowly sweeping up across the
marsh below.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I wish you joy o’ getting him back so
well set up,” said Mr. Barfield, good-naturedly, as
he tied the knot in the string. “It must do your
’eart good, I’m sure, to have him by to give you a
’and again when you ’ave to work for yourself all
the year round.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The widow looked at him, and in her eyes was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>hardness that might well have chilled a braver
man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank you,” she said coldly, “I don’t know as
one day makes much odds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Barfield was silent, and so indeed was Mrs.
Cave, but the plumber’s wife, blundering on, said
patronizingly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There now, you oughtn’t to take it so ungrateful,
and him so nice and obliging to you. There’s
some lads ’ud be so stuck up with being raised up—why,
they might think it beneath ’em to do such
a job!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave smiled, and then laughed outright, and
the old woman’s eyes grew harder than ever.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Barfield brought her change—two coppers
and a threepenny-bit—and laid it on the counter
before her. She took it up without a word, nodded
good-night a trifle more surlily than usual, and
without unlocking her set lips or turning her eyes
once upon either of the two women, passed out
into the dusk. Her face was as thunder.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ’pon my word, it ain’t no sort o’ use
tryin’ to be civil and kindly to ’er,” sighed Mrs.
Neave; but Mr. Barfield, who had seen the
widow’s face, felt a vague sense of pity rise in his
calculating little soul, and said as he stuck his
pen briskly behind his ear after “entering” Mrs.
Neave’s purchase:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We can’t always just tell, ye know. She may
be glad enough to get a sight of ’im though she do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>talk so short, and as like as not she never sent him
round with the linen at all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave was already in the road; she was
watching the mother, who set her face once more
to the sunset, and, whipped by the creeping mist,
struggled on to the cross-roads, where a line of
straight pine-stems stood black against the sky
that flamed beyond the downs: the downs were
blue with mist and the sky was red—red and
angry—and the spare bent figure made a spot
upon it, and that little spot was the blackest in the
whole scene.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” said Mrs. Cave decisively, to those within,
“I shouldn’t think she did send him round with
it! I should like to know what a body’d want to
spend years toilin’ and moilin’ for, except to have
the boy cut a bit of a figure when ’e come back
among them as knowed ’im a little dirty brat!
<i>She</i> sent him indeed!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave stuck her sharp little nose in the air,
and Mrs. Neave retorted stoutly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, if she didn’t send ’im, I should say she’d
be all the better pleased. I s’pose she’s fond o’ the
lad arter her fashion, though, to be sure, she showed
it a queer way when ’e was little. My boys do say
’e was that frightened of her there was times when
they’d a job to get him to go ’ome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And yet,” put in the grocer, “I can call to
mind the day when he fell into the river down
yonder. Some one ran up and told ’er of it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>didn’t know whether the child was alive or dead,
and they do say she went down all of a ’eap like
a corpse of lead. And the doctor told my wife
she’s never been the same woman since. And yet
when the neighbours brought ’im in drippin’’ wet
and queer—if she mustn’t needs go rating ’im for
it all the while she was a puttin’ ’im to bed. I
know she spoke quite sharp to me when I went
round at night to ask after ’im, and yet I could
swear I ’eard her cryin’ over ’im soft and a kissin’
of ’im whiles he slept, as I stood waitin’ at the door.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“She’s a curious piece of goods,” sighed Mrs.
Neave, “for though it don’t scarce seem like truth,
I can recollect I see’d her once bring him a jam-tart
to ’s tea when ’e was spudding thistles one day
down in the marsh, and if you’d believe it, she
kissed ’im just as one of us might ha’ done, ’cos he
looked so pleased.” Mrs. Neave glanced at Mrs.
Cave as one expecting to be disbelieved, but that
shrewder lady only just looked her over and then
burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord,” said she, “ye don’t understand the likes
of ’er, that be certain!” and with a hasty nod to
the company she passed on quickly up the street.</p>

<p class='c015'>The after-glow had faded from the sky behind
the downs, and the sea-mist had ceased to hurry
across the marsh towards them, but had crumbled
and massed itself into mounds and ridges that hung
or floated over the wide, brown plain beneath the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>village—warmed and illumined by the rays of the
bright October moon that had risen red out of the
sea. Upon the little public terrace overhanging
the marsh-land, the village lads were gathered for
their evening pipe; they sat grouped beneath the
thatched roof of the pent-house, men and boys
together, while outside, upon the paved walk, a
few women lounged with babies, taking their
leisure too after the day’s labour. Mrs. Cave came
down among them; she had given the family its
supper, and had put a goodly portion of it to bed,
but she had left the washing-up to her eldest
girl—for Mrs. Cave was sighing for more gossip
upon the great event of the day, and here she
knew that she should find it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be my Jim ’ere?” cried she, as she approached,
alluding to her husband, who was indeed very rarely
anywhere else, unless it were at the public-house.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, o’ course he be! Let the man ’ave his
leisure a bit,” grinned a slatternly girl. And for
the moment Mrs. Cave seemed only too much inclined
to obey her.</p>

<p class='c001'>For within with the men it was Johnnie Collins
again, and Mrs. Cave’s keen eyes had noticed a
black figure standing just opposite in the shadow
of the old gateway, that gave zest to the situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He might as well ha’ brought ’is smart missus
round for us to ’ave a look at,” said one, “but I
s’pose we ain’t fit for such as ’im now-a-days.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lord, it ain’t Johnnie’s fault,” said another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>for Johnnie, though sometimes envied for the odd
shillings he used to earn as a lad, through lending
his handsome face and figure to be an artist’s
model—had yet ever been a favourite, for he had
been the easiest, most good-natured comrade in
the world, and could always be led anywhere by
any one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, there ain’t no beastly pride about Johnnie!”
declared a third, “but they say as ’is missus leads
’im a smarter dance nor ever ’is ’ard old mother
did, and won’t let ’im come nigh the old lady now,
so as ’e has to get away on the sly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave strained her eyes, for she saw the
gaunt figure creep out of the shadow at these
words and quietly climb the village street; it was
the widow as she had thought. Yes, and positively—lounging
slowly down towards her—was that very
son of hers in his elegant suit of grey homespun.
It was as good as a play. Mrs. Cave hurried
softly down the steps by the terrace and warily
followed Widow Collins up the road. Curiosity was
certainly Mrs. Cave’s besetting sin.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, mother,” said the young man softly,
“where have you been? I just went round to the
Vicarage with your basket of linen, and when I
got in again you were gone. Who would ever
have thought to find you a-gossiping! But, there,
indeed it does my heart good to see you hob-nobbing
with the neighbours, and not so lonesome
as you might be.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>The old woman took no note of this that to her
might have seemed a weird jest. She did not even
smile, but she said quickly: “I’m sorry you went
round with the linen, John. There weren’t no call.
I’ve got used to doing it myself now, and I don’t
like it meddled with.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, I always used to,” he began.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she interrupted him sharply. “Never you
mind what you used to do,” she said pettishly,
as though half ashamed of herself. “You ain’t
here all the year round, nor I don’t want you—and
what I do every week you needn’t to do just for
once.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, are you going to blame me now for being
up in London,” he began, nervously laughing, “when
it was you drove me there first?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Blame you!” she cried, and then stopped.
“There,” she said, “you let me be, that’s all I
want. I’ll see to myself so long as I’m above
ground.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He opened his mouth to speak, but she laid a
quick, trembling hand on his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye used to have to mind me,” she said, and her
voice shook a little, “for, Lord knows, I was a bit
’ard with you o’ times! Ye’ve got to do other’s
bidding now, and I’m glad on it. But ye’ll mind
your mother to-day for the last time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave, as she played eavesdropper, involuntarily
thought of the day when her neighbour had
seen the widow give a jam-tart to the lad on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>sly, and she looked for her to kiss him now as she
had kissed him then. But the old woman’s keen
ear had caught the sound of the step behind her,
and though the young fellow stooped towards her
impulsively she pushed him back.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Come,” she whispered, “let’s get ’ome to
supper,” and she tried to hurry up the road, but
not before Mrs. Cave had placed herself abreast
of them, and holding out a friendly hand to
Johnnie, had said effusively: “There, now, I
thought it were Mr. Collins! But, ’pon my word,
it be so long since we’ve seen you ’ere, there ain’t
no knowing you again. And you so smart, too!
Why, you’ll scare care to shake hands with a poor
body like me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They all three stopped, and Johnnie blushed as
he took her hand, perhaps with shame or perhaps
with annoyance, knowing that the woman must have
overheard his mother’s foregoing words—but the
mother’s own face was as iron.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave walked graciously on beside them,
but the widow never glanced at her nor took any
heed of her, but presently just stopped short in
the road, and, hastily producing from her pocket
the yellow envelope of a telegram, said quickly to
her son: “There, I declare, I’d clean forgot! And
I come down here on purpose to find ye too! The
post-mistress brought this ’ere for ye.” And she
held it out to him as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>The young man’s face fell a little, and he held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the document in his hand as though fearing to
open it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had stopped walking, and Mrs. Cave stopped
too, and as neither mother nor son spoke she said
pleasantly to the former: “Well, now I ’ope there’s
no ill news to spoil your treat for you, Mrs. Collins,
for I’m sure you’ll be proud to show him off to us
all to-morrow o’ church time, and small blame to
you. Though to be sure,” added she, turning to
the young man, while the battered bow in her well-worn
bonnet positively wagged with her eagerness,
“ye might ha’ brought your wife with ye to see
your old friends! For all folk do say she’s a lady
born and bred, and it stands to reason we ain’t
good enough for such as that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave smiled, and Mrs. Collins’ face wore
a mingled expression of pride and scorn, as she
listened. She had forgotten the telegram; she
lifted her head royally, gazing with satisfaction in
her weary eyes at this handsome son of hers who
was outwardly so like a gentleman that she might
well be excused for thinking that folk really supposed
him to be one. She thought he was one, and
little guessed that she had blindly done her best to
crush out of him those natural qualities of devotion
and tenderness that were really the most like to
what she desired him to be. If she had been angry
with him for compromising his dignity, it was just
because she was proud of him. She was proud even
of his condescension to her. Yes, she was proud in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>secret to-night, but to-morrow she would be proud
openly—before them all. It would be a triumph
that would more than repay her for many patient
years.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Johnnie had opened the telegram. His face
had changed; one could see it even in the shifting
light of conflicting moon and twilight. There had
been some sort of assurance in it before, and it had
been gay and smiling; now it was tremulous,
ashamed, and frightened.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took out his watch, and the joyful pride
faded out of the old woman’s face as she saw him
do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When’s the last train to Seacombe?” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Half-past nine,” answered Mrs. Cave, for the
mother seemed suddenly to have lost the power of
speech. “But whatever do you want to know that
for?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Johnnie turned to his mother. There was a sort
of shame-faced humility in his attitude that belied
an attempted swagger in his speech. “I shall have
to go into Seacombe to-night, mother,” said he.
“It’s very important. It’s—well, it’s business, you
see, and a man must think of that first of all.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lawk-a-mercy!” cried Mrs. Cave. “And you
scarce ’ere a few hours! Why, there ain’t no business
to do on a Saturday night, man! And you’ll
never get a train back in time for church in the
morning. You’d never disappoint your mother of
that?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>But the old woman had recovered her composure
now, and answered him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Business be always first,” said she, “to them as
wants to get on in the world; and it wouldn’t be a
mother as’d want her son to miss it. Come, John,
there’ll just be time to get your supper afore ye
go.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The two went up the street together, and Mrs.
Cave stood staring after them. Then she went
back to the “Look-out,” and gave the benefit of
her investigations to the village.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It be my belief as that message were from ’is
wife,” cried she. “It be my belief she was cross at
’im coming ’ere, and wasn’t going to let him stay
a minute longer. And, Lord, any one might know
he’d never dare say a masterful woman nay—be it
wife or be it mother! Well, it serves the old soul
right. She brought ’im up above ’is station, and
she druv ’im and druv ’im all the time ’e was
young, and, ’pon my word, ’e be just like a poor
sheep as don’t know which way to run if there
ain’t some one behind ’im with a stick.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet there’s good in the lad, I do believe,” said
the grocer, who had just honoured the terrace for
a few moments with his presence on his way home
from the shop; “and one can’t choose but be sorry
for the woman, for she’s worked ’ard for ’im.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lor’ bless ye, <i>she</i> don’t mind,” laughed Mrs.
Cave. “She’d rather ’ave ’im druv—though it be
away from ’er—than not see ’im keep the ’igh road.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>She knows well enough as some one ’ave got to
drive ’im. But we sha’n’t see Mrs. Collins at chapel
to-morrow mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the latter part of her surmise Mrs. Cave was
not correct. Mrs. Collins appeared at chapel, sternly
neat in her rusty black, and was more gracious
than she had ever been known to be before. As
the little congregation poured out into the mellow
autumn sunshine, where the birches were silver and
yellow against the blue sky, and against the purple
downs, and where the creepers lay crimson upon the
grey walls of the cottages, a burly old farmer came
up to her when she was returning Mrs. Cave’s
commiserating greeting. “Why, Mrs. Collins, that
son o’ your’s ’ave grown a smart young man, and
no mistake,” said he. “I seen ’im get out o’ the
train last night at Seacombe. There was a lady
come to meet ’im. A fine dressed-up lady she were
too, as might ha’ held up ’er ’ead with the best. It
was ’is wife, as I made out. Lucy he called her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave, who had pressed up to hear, shot a
hasty glance at Mr. Barfield, and nodded her head.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the widow did not notice it. Her eyes were
far away on the dancing sea that shone so blue
beyond the mile of yellow marsh where the street
opened at the turn down the hill; she dropped the
heavy lids over the triumph that was in them, but a
flush crept to her sunken cheek, and she pressed her
thin lips together as though to crush the smile that
she knew hovered around them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Yes,” she said, demurely, “Lucy be the name
of my son’s wife.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, and a handsome couple they make, then,”
declared the farmer, “and well-to-do, too, as it seems.
They druv off in a ’ired fly, they did. They’ll be
driving over here next and driving you off along
wi’ ’em.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Again Mrs. Collins closed her lips over a smile.
“I’m too old for strange places,” said she quietly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, well,” said the farmer, “you’ve a son to
be proud of anyways. He’s done well for himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Mrs. Collins lifted her eyes. “He ’ave
done what I meant ’im to do,” she said slowly,
“and I <i>am</i> proud of him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She stood a moment looking round upon them
all one after another, as though tasting her triumph.
Then she shook hands with the farmer, nodded to
the rest, and went away slowly to her lonely cottage
against the downs.</p>

<p class='c001'>The farmer smiled rather foolishly, looking after
her. He knew the widow but little. “Rather a
queer sort of a body, ain’t she?” said he questioningly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aye, sir, that she be indeed,” put in Mrs. Cave,
the ever-ready. “If you’d believe it, she’d sooner
never ’ave seed that son of hers again than ’ave ’ad
’im marry a girl of his own station as wouldn’t have
took ’im away from ’er to make a gentleman of
’im. <i>There’s</i> pride for ye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The farmer looked surprised, but the grocer—approaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>at that moment, fresh from his responsible
Sunday duties in his irreproachable black
clothes—put in his word cheerily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh,” said he, “the women make him out too
bad. ’E’s not a bad sort. ’E’ll be sure to come
back and see her again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And after that the congregation dispersed to their
homes.</p>

<p class='c001'>But though Johnnie Collins was not a bad sort,
though he often begged his mother in a vague sort
of way to come up to London and see him, and
showed nothing but disappointment when she persistently
refused, something always happened at the
last moment to prevent him from coming down to
see her.</p>

<p class='c001'>He often wrote to her and often, too, sent her
little sums of money, which the post-mistress declared
she always cashed with a very sour face;
and once his letter said that he intended to come
and bring his little son to see grandmother. But
“business” as usual intervened, and the little lad
was sent down at last with a maidservant—the
fresh air being considered beneficial for him after
some childish ailment. Then it was that the old
tree might have been said, as it were, to bloom
afresh. All the tenderness that out of a Spartan
pursuit of a distinct and difficult object had been
withheld from her own boy’s childhood was lavished
upon this little flower of her strange ambition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Cave and Mrs. Neave and Mr. Barfield all
had tales to tell of this secret but undoubted transformation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>The fair-haired babe and his stern
grandmother were seen wandering along the lanes
hand in hand as the twilight fell upon the day’s
work, or when the August moon rose at the sun-setting—gold
upon the golden harvest land. He
was seen teazing her at the wash-tub, she patiently
submitting, and she was even known beyond a
doubt to have caught him in her arms in the open
churchyard where the whole village might have
seen her, and to have kissed him there to her
heart’s content.</p>

<p class='c001'>And even when that glad three weeks was over,
and the boy went back to his parents, there were
those who declared that the light never faded again
from the old woman’s eyes till she was laid in the
grave not two months afterwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some one found her dead one day beside her
own lonely fireside. In her hand was a letter from
her son; it contained a £5 note, and said he wished
it could have been more, but that they had an
establishment to keep up now and their expenses
were heavy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Neave was shocked, but Mrs. Cave declared
that Johnnie had fulfilled all that his mother required
of him, and that if she could but have
known that he walked behind her coffin in a well-brushed
suit of black broad-cloth, it would have
added the last touch to her perfect satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>Be that as it may, and though the neighbours
pitied her, there was a peaceful and a triumphant
smile on the dead, old face.</p>

<p class='c015'>The postman came swinging down the village
street. It was morning, but the street was already
astir, for though it was but early spring, and the
apple-blossom was not yet out, the weather was
warm, and those who found spare moments managed
to get to the cottage doors and look out upon
the sunshine.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the corner the mill-wheel was going round,
and upon the bridge that spanned the stream a
knot of girls had gathered, with whom the miller’s
son and a young farmer on his way to the early
train were holding merry converse.</p>

<p class='c001'>The postman came past. He bore the character
of a surly fellow, though he was young yet, and
should have been too well-mannered not to throw
a civil word to a pretty girl. But some said he
had been disappointed in love, and had sworn
never to look at woman more.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, never a letter for me?” cried the foremost
of the girls, planting herself full in his path as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>he went by. “I’m sure I don’t know what you’re
a postman for, Mr. Frewin, for it don’t seem to me
as if ye ever had nothing to carry!”</p>

<p class='c001'>She planted her arms akimbo and laughed in
his face, her own a blaze of sweet merriment, too
pretty to be bold, and too frank and sincere to be
anything but captivating.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Ben Frewin neither answered nor looked up,
and the girl drew back baffled, but no wit discomposed,
as he strode past her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not a bit of it, ye’ll never do it, Letty,” laughed
another of the girls, and the young farmer lit his
pipe with a merry twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I shouldn’t like to say as Miss Letty
couldn’t do any blessed thing as she pleased,”
declared he gallantly, “but I’m bound to allow,
it don’t look likely so far.” And he nodded to
them all round as he went on his way to the
station.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What don’t look like it?” asked the young
miller, coming out of the mill with his whitened
face. He had not heard the last passage of arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ere’s Letty Cox swears she’ll get Mr. Frewin
to be her beau for a Sunday evening,” laughed one
of the girls, nudging her friend good-humouredly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller looked at Letty sharply; then he
smiled.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Bob Frewin ’ain’t been seen walking with a
young ’ooman since Bett throwed him over,” said
he.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Well that ain’t no reason,” smiled Letty with
a little pout, and a killing glance from under the
black fringes of her soft grey eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller answered it as it became him to do,
and the girl who had spoken before giggled: “Lor,
ain’t she just a bit set up?” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the miller did not seem to mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye promised to walk with <i>me</i> next Sunday
though,” said he persuasively.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There’s no tellin’ what I might be wantin’ to
do next Sunday,” said she. “It might be rainin’
for aught we know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It might,” allowed he. “But again it mightn’t,
and if it don’t—well, ye promised.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Did I then?” repeated Letty innocently. “Well,
there’s other Sundays, and I bet Mr. Frewin shall
walk with me one on ’em.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Done with you for a pair o’ gloves,” cried the
miller, laughing, “for I bet he won’t!” And
Letty flushed and demurred, for such a precise
arrangement as this had not occurred to her; but
the girls were delighted and wouldn’t let her refuse.</p>

<p class='c001'>“They’ll be sure to be a nice pair, Letty,”
whispered they. And Letty thought so too, and
since she was so very, very sure to succeed, it
seemed a pity to forego both the gift and the glory
of winning it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All right then,” said she at last, blushing still
and smiling; “when ’ave it got to be?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sunday come three weeks,” declared he; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the other girls meant to see fair play, and vowed
that this was far, very far from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, if a woman can’t make a fool of a man in
three weeks, she ain’t goin’ to do it at all,” answered
he. “Ye did for me in one!”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a roar at this, and at that very
moment the cause of all this commotion strode back
again down the road passing the bridge by on the
left this time, with his bundle of sorted letters in
his right hand and his bag slung in front of him.
He might very well have heard the miller’s last
words, for they had been spoken in a loud voice,
but his face was inscrutable, though the scowl upon
it had deepened momentarily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well,” added the miller, as he watched him
pass, “I’ll grant ye you’ve a tough job, so we’ll say
Sunday come four weeks. That’ll throw ye in
Bank ’Oliday, and I’m sure that ought to count
double.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girls giggled afresh as the miller went indoors.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My, what a lark, Letty,” said one. “I wish it
was me. My best gloves ain’t fit to be seen. But
I don’t suppose ye’ll get ’em.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then they all parted and ran off to their
various jobs, and left Letty, with the only one who
lived up her way, to climb the village street to the
old farm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish now as I ’adn’t done it,” sighed the girl
half seriously.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>But the other rallied and encouraged her, envying
her secretly between whiles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The farm stood above the village, on a common
that was breezy when the valley lay languid in the
heat; cherry and plum-trees were a-bloom in the
orchard, and daffodils along the sides of the straight
brick-paved walk that led from the gate to the old-fashioned
porch.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Letty stood in that porch the very self-same
evening drying her plump brown arms on a cloth
after washing up the tea-things, the postman
stopped at the gate and began looking through the
letters in his left hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl hung down her head and blushed; she
was resolved, but she had not thought she would
have to begin so soon; she was not ready.</p>

<p class='c001'>As it so happened she could not have opened
her campaign more neatly. He had always set
her down as a bit of a bold-faced hussy, and had
never looked at her properly, but with her eyes
cast down, and her fresh cheek flushed with a
modest pink, he was fain to take a good stare at
her, waiting for her to come down to the gate and
take the letter as usual.</p>

<p class='c001'>But somehow she did not come, and he was
forced to go up the garden walk to the porch.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve got something for ye at last,” said he
stiffly as she did not speak. “I ’ope it’ll be good
news.” And he handed the letter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Still she did not look up; her courage had all
forsaken her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Shall I lay it down ’ere?” said he, pointing to
the window-sill.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, do,” answered she, “my ’ands is wet;” and
then she stole a glance at him and he felt the softness
of her grey eyes flash suddenly into his.</p>

<p class='c001'>She lowered hers again at once, but the first
shot in the war had been most successfully fired,
although she did not guess it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He blushed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good evening to you,” said he hastily.</p>

<p class='c001'>And he strode down the path again and swung
to the latch-gate with a jerk.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again Letty was sorry that she had made that
silly wager.</p>

<p class='c001'>The days passed by, and the postman had not
come again to the farm with a letter, neither would
the now unwilling besieger of his heart have found
an opportunity of addressing him again, even had
she desired to do so.</p>

<p class='c001'>He kept himself aloof, and not all the chaff of
more envious companions, nor the merry persuasion
of her clever friends, could induce the girl to accost
him as she had so frankly done before she had
undertaken to win him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The miller’s Sunday came round. In fresh
shirt-front and well-brushed hat he turned up, as
arranged, to take her for the promised walk.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“It’s goin’ to rain,” said Letty, “the clouds is
awful black.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We won’t go far,” answered the young man,
“and I can ’old the umbrella over your ’at and
feathers if it should come down a bit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So Letty went, but it was against her will, though
she couldn’t have told you why, for the miller was
a likely man for a husband, seeing that he was as
handsome a fellow as any in the village, and had
about the best prospects. She laughed and chatted
and chaffed, however, as was her wont, and how
was the postman to know, when they met him
presently going soberly to evening church with
his old mother, that she was not quite so merry
for the rest of the way, and went home quite half-an-hour
earlier than she had intended?</p>

<p class='c001'>But that might have been because the rain came
down as she had prophesied, and she had supper
to get at home, and could not risk being late by
staying at the mill till the storm was over, as the
miller’s mother had begged her to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless her skirt was drenched when she
got to the top of the hill. Perhaps it was a fellow
feeling in the matter of having one’s Sunday best
spoilt that made her take her courage in both
hands and accost the postman when she met him
again, just at her own door, walking without any
protection against the weather in his black broad-cloth
and tall hat.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“Won’t ye take the loan o’ my umbrella, Mr.
Frewin?” said she timidly. “It’s comin’ down
wonderful hard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Ben Frewin stopped, and as luck would have it,
looked at her.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her eyes were wistful, and there was a bashful
sort of appeal in them that he had never seen there
before. <i>He</i> could not account for it, but she might
have done so; that is to say, she might have done
so if she had been in the habit of analyzing her
feelings. As it was, she did not know that shame
for what she had undertaken was at the bottom of
the sudden fit of apologetic coyness that made her
so doubly and unconsciously fascinating.</p>

<p class='c001'>From any one else, and still more from her at
any other moment, Frewin would curtly have
refused the offered civility. But she looked so
timid and so anxious, standing there in the rain
with her skirts gathered round her, and the umbrella
half held out towards him, that he hadn’t the
courage to snub her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, it’s real kind of you,” said he. “But
ye’ll have to run indoors first, or ye’ll spoil yer
pretty ’at.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She turned and tripped up the path, and he
must needs of course follow, the gate slamming to
behind him. At the porch she closed the umbrella
and held it out to him, but a voice from within
called out authoritatively:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Whatever don’t ye ask Mr. Frewin to step
indoors for, Letty? Ye’ll both get wet to the skin
out there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Please won’t ye come in?” repeated the girl
obediently. “Mother and me ’ll be very pleased.”
And of course she had to lift those grey eyes up
to his again, and though he had sworn that he
would never cross glance with theirs more, yet he
found his gaze entangled afresh, and for an instant
did not remove it. Then his senses awoke to their
danger, and he donned his armour again hastily.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thank ye,” said he almost roughly, “I won’t
come in now, if you please. And there ain’t no
call to trouble ye for the humbrella neither. The
rain’s a’most over.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She was looking out into the garden, and would
not see that disputed article which he was holding
out towards her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh no,” declared she. “It’s pourin’ still.
Mother won’t be pleased if ye don’t step in for five
minutes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But he was on his guard now, and obdurate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not to-night,” said he shortly. And he placed
the umbrella beside her against the lintel of the
door. “Men ain’t afraid of a drop o’ rain, ye know,
same as a girl’d be for sake of ’er smart clothes.
It’s lucky for you it didn’t come on so ’ard when
you was out a-walking with Mr. Lambert.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Lambert was the young miller, and at any
other time Letty would have tittered delighted at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>this covert proof of jealousy. But to-night she was
half-hurt and half-frightened at it, and shrank back
into herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As you please,” answered she, pouting a little.
And when he had gone, and she went in to get the
tea, she was quite cross at being scolded for not
having made him come in, and cross again with
her friend who ran over from her home opposite
when the storm was past, and congratulated her
upon having got that far towards the winning of
her bet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t want to win no bet,” declared she.
“He’s a uncivil sort of a chap, and I don’t know as
I cares to ’ave nothink to do with ’im. And what’s
more, I don’t think as bettin’s nice for girls, and I
don’t know as I shall go on with it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, whatever did ye do it for then?” cried
the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because ye was all a-worryin’ of me on, I suppose,”
retorted Letty, with a sharpness very unlike
her usual merry and good-humoured self.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t ought to go for a thing and not stick
to it,” said her friend, vexed to see such a good
piece of fun fall flat. “But there, ye’ll do it yet.
Ye never was one to cry ‘’Ware!’ There’s no ’arm
in it. It’s only for a bit of a lark, and he’s fair
sport, he’s such a mooney, thinkin’ as he can walk
through without seein’ us. I like his cheek.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there’s no tellin’ what I may do and what
I mayn’t do,” said Letty, tossing her head, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>that she was perfectly right, and many had said it
of her before.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The gloves’ll be beauties, that I’ll take my oath
of,” said the girl encouragingly as she went.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless time passed, and nothing of great
moment occurred in this interesting duel that so
many were eagerly watching, while one at least
of the combatants was unaware of being engaged
in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>One day, coming home from the next station
where she had been to see a married sister, Letty
found herself alone in the same carriage with Bob
Frewin, who had had occasion to go to the town
hard by. And though no one could exactly accuse
him of an on-coming disposition, any one who had
seen him would have allowed that the postman was
more friendly than he had been to a girl for many a
long day. Letty had noticed it herself, and though
piqued by his manner on that wet Sunday, she had
begun with her proudest and most off-hand mood—the
mood that always “fetched” the men, but
which, to do her justice, she would not have dreamed
of intentionally trying on such a tough customer—she
lapsed into her apologetic and gentle manner
long before the journey was over. And when they
reached their destination, and Letty, in shame-faced
distress, found that she had dropped her return
ticket, and must pay the fare over again, it was not
Frewin’s loan that she would accept to replenish
her empty purse. As it so happened, Mr. Lambert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>was there, going off to London, and it was his
shilling that Letty chose to take, declaring that
as he lived close by, she could the more easily
repay it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was what the men called a woman’s excuse
that didn’t bear sifting, and it naturally had the
effect of sending Frewin off with a flea in his ear
and a sour face, so that the miller very cheerfully
declared to Letty in confidence, that he didn’t see
any call to buy the gloves in readiness, as he had
intended to do that very day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Things, in fact, were not going at all hopefully
for Letty’s wager, which was perhaps the reason
why she was going about with a more serious expression
than her careless beauty had ever worn
before, and why she never appeared on the bridge
of an evening now, and even went past knots of
her old comrades in the village with a hasty nod
or such a conscious bit of chaff as might have
betrayed to any one her unusual state of mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bank Holiday loomed in the near distance without
the wager being any nearer the winning than
three weeks ago. And if it had not been for an
unforeseen incident perhaps it would never have
been won at all. But won it was, and this was
how it came about.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a bright, clear spring morning. A keen
east wind was blowing the cherry-blossom about,
and the narcissus and daffodils along the cottage
path swayed beneath it; but the sun was shining,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and it was a good drying day, so Letty had just
set to at the week’s washing, and was standing
with her arms white in suds, when she saw Frewin
open the gate and come slowly—very slowly—up
to the door. She dried her hands and went to
open it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He held out a black-edged letter towards her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m sure I ’ope it ain’t bad news,” said he sadly.</p>

<p class='c001'>She took it with a frightened face, still drying her
hands mechanically. He turned his back, preparing
to depart; yet he waited until she had opened it.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little low ripple of laughter broke from her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I suppose I ought to be ashamed to
laugh,” said she. “But, Lor’, it give me such a
fright I can’t ’elp but be pleased. Ye see, my
brother’s away at sea, and it do give ye a turn
when ye get a thing like this. But it’s only to say
as old Aunt Porter’s gone, and she’s been bedridden
and childish this ten years, and I ’aven’t seed her
for twenty! Mother’d say it weren’t seemly of me
not to take on, but, truth to tell, I’m so pleased it
ain’t Jim, I can’t seem to mind much.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course not,” assented the postman. "Old
folks is bound to go,"—and he sighed—“and when
they’s lost their wits and their limbs ’tis but a ’appy
release, as the saying is. Well, I’m glad it ain’t
nothink wrong with yer brother,” he said as he
turned to go. But he said it sadly, and sighed again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Letty put the letter in her pocket, and lifted her
eyes to his with their sweetest, kindest look.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“It’s very friendly o’ you to mind whether the
news was good or bad,” said she with a little laugh.
“I’m sure it ain’t many as’d care a rap. Do you
mind all the black-edged letters as ye give round
now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was just a thought of roguishness in the
smile, and just a suspicion of the old coquettish
air in the tilt of the dainty face; but it must only
have been from habit, for the pretty grey eyes were
a little dewy still, and the voice had none of the
usual raillery in its tone.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Frewin did not answer her question, and
his quiet young face was still sad and preoccupied
as he said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m in trouble myself to-day. I’d be sorry to
bring the same to anybody.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her expression changed at once; every trace
of coquetry was wiped out of it in a twinkling.
She came a step nearer to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In trouble!” echoed she. “Now I <i>am</i> sorry.
But p’r’aps ye wouldn’t care to tell, me being but
a stranger, so to speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know as you’re so much a stranger,”
he began, and then he broke off. “I ha’n’t got
nobody but mother,” he added in a moment,
irrelevantly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, she ain’t sick?” cried the girl quickly,
with real feeling in her voice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Got to go to the ’orspital,” answered Frewin
shortly. “It’s her eyes. They say as she’ll be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>stone blind if she don’t ’ave su’thing done immediate.
They say as it’d be coward-like o’ me not
to persuade her to it, for it’s sarten-sure to be all
right; but, Lor’, I ain’t got no faith in doctors.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Letty was silent—most likely she shared his
opinion, and could find nothing consolatory to say,
but her pretty face was full of sympathy. He
allowed himself one piece of comfort; he looked
at it. Their eyes met, and hers filled with tears;
but not before she had poured something into his
that was not only sympathy.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good-day,” said he quickly, and in another
minute he was hurrying down the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the wager was won, though the village little
guessed it, and though Letty gave that part of the
matter never a thought just then—never a thought
till Bank Holiday came and went without her
having so much as a bit of a swain for the day—never
a thought till the girls came up and laughed
at her, and pitied her for having spent it sitting
alone in the chimney-corner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she thought of it, but not as they imagined.
She did not tell them that she might have had the
handsome miller for a “walking-stick” without
any trouble at all—that he had laughingly declared
he was in luck’s way, since he was like to keep the
gloves and get her company as well, upon which
she had tossed her head with all those old airs of
supremacy which so forsook her in her intercourse
with Bob Frewin, and told him that he might keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the gloves and welcome, but that her company he
should never have again; she did not tell them
that she might have been winning her wager that
very afternoon, but that the young postman had
been obliged to use this one day off duty to take
his mother up to the hospital; she did not tell
them, because she was doing her very best to forget
she had ever made that wager at all.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she was destined to win it for all that. The
operation on the old woman’s eyes passed off most
successfully, and every morning and every evening
as Bob Frewin strode up and down the village
street, with his post-bag swinging in front of him,
and his sorted bundle of letters in his left hand,
Letty managed to be somewhere about in the
garden or the porch just to hear the last news of
the invalid.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Saturday evening came, the weather, that
had been wet all the week, cleared up for a fine
Sunday; it was the very last Sunday that was left
to win the wager in, but it was not on that account
that Letty’s heart beat as she saw Frewin stop at
the wicket, and not seeing her in the front garden,
fumble a minute at the latch, and come half
reluctantly up to the porch.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was glad that she was in the orchard beside
the house, taking down the linen that she had
hung out in the morning to dry—for the big apple-tree,
that was pink with budding bloom, sheltered
her, and from behind the sheet that she was just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>going to unfasten from the line she could watch
him unseen.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she wondered whether her mother would
say where she was, and she just edged a little
further beyond her ambuscade as she saw him turn
away from the door.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her heart beat, but—yes, mother had told, or
else he had seen her, for he came towards her
through the side wicket.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she came forward, and her smile was so
tremulous, and her cheeks so blushing, that he
seemed to forget all his stand-offishness and any
cause of offence that he might have, and to take
heart of grace from her bashfulness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye are busy,” said he, “but I won’t keep ye
long. Mother’s getting on first-rate, and the Sister
has writ me a line for her. There’s a message for
you in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The grey eyes went up to his.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do call that kind,” said she. “What is
it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the young man who blushed now.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s a foolish message,” said he with a little
laugh. “But mothers are that way. Anyway it
don’t seem fair not to give it ye.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, never mind,” faltered the girl, for there was
a misgiving at her heart. But he had taken the
letter out of his pocket.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell Letty Cox,” he said, “as I thank her for
her kindness to my lad in his trouble.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“Kindness!” repeated she tremulously, and with
downcast face.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, when a feller’s a bit down, miss, ye
wouldn’t think how it sort o’ cheers ’im up to ’ave
somebody ’pear to care. It’s not many thinks of
an old woman, but mother’s all the world to
me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course she is,” murmured Letty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Leastways,” added the postman, rather darkly,
“I didn’t think as I should ever think of another
female but ’er again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” said Letty softly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But there’s never no tellin’ what folks’ll do—man
nor woman,” added Frewin wisely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” said Letty again.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then there was a pause, during which she
unfixed another white sheet from against the gentle
blue of the evening sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’ll excuse me if I’m too free, miss,” said
Frewin presently. “But you see—well, there, it
was talk o’ the village, so ye must ’ave ’eard it
with the rest! I was fooled once, and that’s the
truth, and I don’t mean to be fooled again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no answer, and Letty’s face was
somehow hidden behind the blushing blossom of a
low branch of the apple-tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So p’r’aps you’d excuse me,” he repeated, “if
I was to ask you, as a plain man, whether you was
a-walkin’ with Lambert o’ Bank ’Oliday when I
was in town?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>The face emerged from behind its leafy screen,
and was no longer tremulous but haughty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, it <i>is</i> a queer question,” said she, “and no
mistake! But,” she added quickly, seeing him
turn away,—“well, there, I don’t mind answering:
Mr. Lambert asked me, but I didn’t fancy ’im. I
sat alone all day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And it may have been the shame of such a
confession from an acknowledged village belle that
called the blush again to her cheek.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye don’t say so, now,” declared the man,
pleased. “Ye see, ye took Lambert’s loan as
against mine the other day at the station, and, one
thing and another—well, there—a man ain’t goin’
to be fooled twice, you bet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At the last word she hung her head lower than
ever, and there was another pause.</p>

<p class='c001'>At last he said, sheepishly now: “But I don’t
s’pose ye would walk with me next Sunday.
Though it seems clearin’ up for a nice day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He waited for an answer, but none came. Only
after a minute or so a little sound as of stifled
sobbing came from behind the white screen.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lor, whatever is the matter?” cried Frewin
aghast. “Is it me that’s upset ye, my dear?
There, ye don’t need to come if ye don’t want
to. Any girl can say a feller nay. There’s no
’arm done yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But still she cried on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’d come right enough,” faltered she at last,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>between the sobs. “But—but there <i>is</i> ’arm
done.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then suddenly she dried her eyes, and
looked up at him with frank, fearless gaze.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Your mother said as I’d been kind to ye, Mr.
Frewin,” said she. “But I ’ain’t been—for I’ve
behaved bad to ye. Yes, I ’ave. And ye said as
you weren’t goin’ to be fooled again. And—and
I like ye too well to fool ye, and that’s truth.
And—and so I’d rather tell ye as I <i>’ave</i> fooled ye
already.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His face went white, and he stared at her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Fooled me!” echoed he. “Not a bit of it!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, I ’ave,” insisted she doggedly. “The girls
said ye was a rude, surly chap as wouldn’t throw
a word to any of us, and I swore I’d make you.
And then Charlie Lambert dared me to, and
wagered me a pair o’ gloves it’d be no go. It was
just a lark,” said she half defiantly, but then
added, with a tell-tale throb of the voice, “though
you can’t say as I’ve ever done it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frewin did not smile, the unconscious humour
of the phrase did not seem to strike him; he was
upset.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was a dirty trick to play on a chap,” said
he at last, “and Lambert shall pay me out for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, come, that ain’t fair,” said Letty quickly.
“It <i>was</i> a dirty trick, and I knew that soon as ever
I’d done it, but it was me that did it, and it’s me
as has got to pay.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>“Ye seem bound to stand up for Lambert,”
growled Frewin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Letty looked up; she clenched her fist.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I <i>’ate</i> ’im,” said she between her teeth. “Yes,
I do,” she repeated, though half shame-facedly, as
he gazed at her surprised. “I <i>’ate</i> ’im, ’cos it was
’im as made me do it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Ate ’im, do you?” echoed Frewin, with the ghost
of a contented smile. “Well, may be that’s fair.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t care if it’s fair or no,” declared Letty
stoutly. “May be it ain’t, for I’d ought to ha’
known better myself, but I ’ate ’im all the same.
Though that ain’t no reason why you should
mention the matter to ’im, for it stands to reason
I’d no call to agree to what ’e said, and it’s me as
’as got to pay.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was ’e ought to ha’ known better,” grumbled
Frewin again, still with a scowl on his honest face,
“for ’e’s a man, and you expect a man to know
better nor a girl.” But, after a pause, the scowl
fading just a trifle, and the smile broadening
instead: “So you ’ate ’im, do you?” he asked
once more.</p>

<p class='c001'>Letty dried her eyes afresh, and it was her turn
to smile just a wee little bit. She had watched
these symptoms before—for was she not the village
belle?—and even in the midst of her misery
and remorse she could not help smiling as she
recognized them under a new guise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“O’ course I do,” she repeated emphatically.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Then she turned and pulled down another sheet
off the line, and another and another, till her arms
were quite full.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile Frewin stood watching her, indecision
in every line of his face and figure. She
was very pretty, very graceful about her work, very
strong and hearty. Her fresh cheeks were pink
even amid the pink blossom, and her golden hair
shone against the golden sky, where the sun was
setting on a bank of soft rose-washed grey clouds
behind the trees of the orchard.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I s’pose anyways ye are sure to be taken up
to-morrow evening?” said he at last. “A pretty
girl like you always is o’ Sundays.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, if you know as I’m taken up, I s’pose I
must be,” said she with a little pout.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye didn’t answer just now,” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe ye didn’t ask,” retorted she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there, I’ll ask now,” said he with a bit
of a shame-faced laugh. “Ye ’ave got a way with
ye, miss, and no mistake!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t ask to please me,” she said with the old
toss of the little head. But the smile took the
venom out of the words, and Frewin bowed beneath
it as he had been slowly bowing ever since he first
felt the flash of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, I’ll ask to please myself,” said he. And
he went up to her and took her one free hand in
his. Then the blushes crept right up into the
bright hair, and there was silence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“But we won’t walk hereabouts,” murmured she
after a pause. “I’d not like to meet—folks. I tell
ye what I should like if mother ’ll spare me, and
that’d be for to go off right early and up in the
train to see yer poor mother.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would ye now?” declared he, well satisfied.
“She’d be rare and pleased. Then that’s what
we’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The grey eyes stole a look at him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And by-gones to be by-gones?” begged she
timidly. “And not a word to Charlie Lambert?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He frowned a little.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s as I sees fit,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No, it’s as I sees fit,” murmured she softly, and
her face was very close to his.</p>

<p class='c001'>He smiled vaguely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You leave Charlie Lambert to me,” she added
presently. “He pretty soon knew I was off it
as soon as I was on. He’s got a flea o’ mine in
his ear a’ready, and ’e’ll ’ave another if ’e don’t
look out. You leave ’em all to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I s’pose everybody’s bound to do yer bidding
sooner or later,” laughed Frewin half ruefully, “me
as well as most.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, don’t you make no mistake about that,”
smiled she. “And what’s more, don’t ye ever go
for to fancy that because I was such a bold-faced
silly as to lay that wager I ever went for to win it.
If ever there was a man I <i>didn’t</i> try to catch, it was
you.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Frewin laughed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ve caught me though,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That’s as may be,” she said. “But I was too
frightened at what I’d done to fish for you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“P’r’aps that’s ’ow ye caught me then,” he said.
“And p’r’aps that’s ’ow I must needs forgive ye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>So the wager was won, but never paid.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the trip to town was so deftly managed from
a neighbouring station in the early hours of the
Sunday, that nobody guessed it had taken place;
and on the evening of the same day upon the old
bridge, Letty swore a bold, brave lie that she had
lost what she declared she had never tried to win.
The laugh against her was loud, but then so was
her own in reply, and when, six weeks later, instead
of accepting Mr. Lambert’s gloves, she accepted
Bob Frewin himself, she was too happy to care
which way the laugh went. But to tell the truth,
folk are good-natured enough; and if the girls
suspected Letty’s little fraud, and, nudging one
another, declared she was a clever one, they had no
objection to her triumph, for Charlie Lambert was
the better match of the two, and he was left for
somebody else.</p>

<p class='c015'>Two women and a lad came down the hill
towards the stream on a frosty January evening at
sunset.</p>

<p class='c001'>It had been a good typical Christmas, and though
the snow had partially disappeared, the river ran
grey in the cold air, and the frost sparkled on the
twigs of willows and on the brown stalks of tall
water plants upon the banks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lad lounged easily along with his cap on
the back of his head, his hands in his breeches
pockets, and his pipe in his mouth; but the women
bore burthens—one a bundle of brushwood on her
head, the other a sack of potatoes—and as they
reached the bridge they stopped to rest them
awhile on its old brick parapet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Old yer row, do!” the boy was saying. “What
do it matter to you whether old Jeremiah ’ave
a-turned me off agin or no? Ain’t I my own
master?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, ye’re yer own master safe enough,” retorted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the woman, a sharp-featured body of middle age.
“There ain’t nobody as ’ll worrit ’emselves much
over ye now ye’ve put yer pore mother underground.
If that’s what ye wanted when ye set to
work to break ’er ’eart, why ye’ve got it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I want it now anyways,” retorted the
lad with a brutal laugh.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re an ungrateful beast, that’s what ye are!”
said the woman shrilly. “I’d ’ave guv ye bite and
sup for a night or two, for my pore sister’s sake, till
ye got work again; but I shan’t now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nobody asted ye to!” laughed the lad. “When
ye guv me a shake-down before ye said ye did it
for ’er, but ye wanted my earnin’s all the same.
And when I was turned off the farm ye turned
me out in the road. I’d sooner shift for myself,
thank ye!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do it, then!” retorted the woman. “It looks
like it, it do, and you sent adrift agin this very
night! Lord, to think the devil o’ drink can get
into a lad afore ’e’s forgot ’is mother’s milk!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you don’t stop that jaw I’ll——” began the
boy.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the other woman laid a hand on his arm.
She had a fresher, plumper, kindlier face than her
neighbour, and she gave him a little friendly push
as she whispered—</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, now, there, she’s yer own mother’s sister
ye know. You go ’ome.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mother’s sister be damned,” said the lad irreverently.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“She’s come that dodge over me long
enough. She wouldn’t lift a finger to ’elp me, and
I won’t ’ave no more of ’er preachments. I ain’t
got no one to think of, and what I earns I’ll spend
as I please.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A jolly lot you ever did hanything else,”
began the aunt afresh, but the neighbour stopped
her mouth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now you go ’ome, Nat, you go on ’ome,” reiterated
she to the boy; and “Can’t ye see as yer
on’y aggrawatin’ the lad, Mary Ann?” she whispered
to the woman. “Let ’im be, do! Maybe ’e
misses his ’ome and his pore mother more than
you thinks for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But Nat laughed as he blew the ashes from his
pipe.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye needn’t trouble to speak up for me, marm,”
he sneered. “Lord, she don’t ’urt me, bless you,”
and he snapped his fingers in the direction of his
relative. “A precious sight I ever cared for the
women-folk’s jaw. Oh, yes, I’ll go <i>’ome</i>,” and
something that somehow did not belong to the
scowl flitted across the passionate young face that
self-indulgence had so sorrowfully marred. “I’ll
go <i>’ome</i>! But where I goes there I bides—ye ’ear
that? No one ain’t got no right to interfere wi’
me. I won’t never darken <i>your</i> doors no more,
and if I’m a-goin’ to the devil I’ll go my own
way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He stuck his cap on the back of his head again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>and his hands in his pockets, and lounged up the
road singing a scrap of a low song in a louder
voice than he could keep quite steady.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s a pity, so it is,” murmured the stout
woman, looking after him. “There was the
makin’s of a nice lad in ’im once, I’ll be sworn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re a new comer to the place,” retorted
Mary Ann, “and that’s all you knows! If ’is pore
mother didn’t fret the very guts out of ’erself
a-tryin’ to bring ’im up respeckable! But the
devil of ’is father were in ’im—that’s where it was.
The low brute that man was! And died same as
’e lived. Found on the road—i’stead o’ dyin’
respeckable in ’is bed! As if ’e ’adn’t ha’ done
the woman injury enough! Why—there was a
Crowner’s inquest and all! But, Lor’, when all
was said and done, I declare I niver spent a comfortabler
’alf hour than when I seed ’em nail ’im
down! For, ye see, I says to myself: ‘Clara ’ll
take on a bit, but she’s well rid on ’im. She can
work to bring <i>one</i> up, and the boy ’ll soon be able
to work for ’er.’ Lord, I didn’t reckon as ’e’d be a
wuss devil nor ’is father, bad luck to ’im!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“May be ’is pore mother spoiled ’im, being but
the one, so to speak,” said the other half apologetically.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Spoiled ’im!” laughed the other, preparing to
shoulder her burthen again. “I reckon she did!
Many’s the time I swore she’d be punished for
it!”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Well, I s’pose she was,” said the neighbour
simply. “There, pore soul, I’m sorry for ’er.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“’E broke ’er ’eart, ’e did, the young scoundrel,”
growled Mary Ann, as she hitched the bundle of
brushwood forward on to her back. “And I’m
sure I ’ope he’ll break his own neck.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, come, don’t say that,” murmured the gentler
spirit reprovingly. “I dare say ’e’s lonesome
enough anyways.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lonesome!” sneered the incensed relative.
“Much use ’e made of ’er company when ’e’d got
it! Out on the roads, or what not, from night till
morn and more! Didn’t ye ’ear ’im say precious
little ’e cared for the women’s jaw? Precious little
’e did. Precious little ’e cared for aught about ’er,
pore soul. Why, ’e was dead drunk the very day
of ’er funeral!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mary Ann trudged forward as she spoke, hurling
the words out against the wind under the penthouse
of her burthen, and the sympathetic neighbour,
standing behind her with her hands in her
hips, shook her head sadly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That was bad,” she murmured, “that was bad,
sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she too turned to take up her load.</p>

<p class='c001'>The potatoes were heavy; she failed to raise
them on to her back at the first effort.</p>

<p class='c001'>Just then the gate on to the railway line slammed
to, and a girl coming down on to the bridge hurried
forward and gave her a lift with them.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“Thank ye, thank ye,” said the woman. And
when she had settled her burthen comfortably,
glancing up to see who had helped her, she added
again: “Oh, thank ye. Ye’re a stranger in the
parish, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl blushed. She was pretty enough, but
she was thin and pale, not to say wan, and her
cotton dress was poor covering for the wintry day,
and her ill-fitting black jacket and shabby straw
hat betokened an even greater poverty than was
usual in the village.</p>

<p class='c001'>She blushed as one who knew the tone and the
words, and was wont to understand beneath them
the insinuation, “You’re a tramp.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But she was mistaken. The woman before her
prided herself on knowing a respectable female
when she saw her, and though poor and miserable,
the girl did not look “a bad ’un.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m a-goin’ on further,” said she evasively.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh!” said the woman again. Then, as not
wishing to be inquisitive, she added, “Well,
thank ye. I wish ye a good evenin’. It’s cold
weather; it’s best to walk fast to keep warm.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she nodded, moving on quickly to suit her
action to her words.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good evenin’,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c001'>But she did not follow the advice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though she carried but the smallest of little
bundles, she rested it on the brick parapet as
the women had done with their heavier loads,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>and stood looking down the river into the afterglow.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was four o’clock. The sun had set, and the
poplars that crossed the stream and the fields,
dividing meadow-land from water-cress grounds,
shot straight arrows against a pale crimson sky,
that was cool even in its fire in the cold, crisp air.
Every little bare twig on the slender, bare boughs
of the poplars pointed upwards; the willows by
the river, though less spare and less commanding,
modestly followed their example; the sky might
have been constraining with its tender glory, but
the girl—after one glance around on the clear-cut
winter landscape, so calm with the patience of
waiting Nature, but so cruelly silent with the
dearth of stirring life—fastened her eyes on the
water and on the water alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>The long strings of half-dead, slimy weed that
swayed idly to and fro, attached and yet floating,
like the traveller’s joy on a summer’s day a-moving
in the wind—or better, yes, much better still—like
some dank, clinging cotton stuffs, held to the
gravel bed by some heavy weight, yet erring softly,
saturated with much water, on the bosom of the
stream—these seemed to fascinate her beyond the
power to tear away her gaze.</p>

<p class='c001'>At last she shivered—the frost was intense—and
lifted her head and sighed, a long, miserable,
moaning sigh. Then she put her hand in her pocket
and drew forth a letter—a letter and a thimble.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>The moon, that had risen in time to see the sun
go down, had just crept high enough in the sky to
shine through the bare branches of the elms in the
meadow beside the lower stream: it shone now
upon the paper which the girl held trembling in
her hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t ye come back here,” said the letter.
“There ain’t no work to be got ’ere, and I’ve my
hands full enough to keep them as are left.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was more, but she did not read it. She
crushed the paper in her hands, and let it flutter
slowly down into the water, but the thimble she
put back into her pocket. Then she rested her
two elbows on the brick parapet and leaned her
head in them and cried softly to herself, still
looking down into the darkening water as it lapped
to and fro over the swaying body of weeds.</p>

<p class='c001'>A bell sounded from the village on the hill; it
cut clear and sharp across the frosty air; it was
the bell from the straw-plaiting factory, sending
the girls home from their day’s work. She knew
it well enough, and roused herself at the sound,
moving her hand to take up her little bundle once
more. But in the waning light she pushed it
forward instead of grasping it, and, in spite of a
quick clutch, it slipped over the rounded edge of
the parapet and fell with a thud into the river
below. She gave a little cry as she followed it
with her eyes, leaning over a long way to try and
descry it in the green water beneath.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>But there was nothing to be seen but the same
swaying, dank body of weeds. And presently she
gave a low, harsh laugh, and shrugged her
shoulders, and pulling her miserable little black
jacket across her chest, as though to persuade it to
cling more closely to her frail, shivering body, she
turned away and walked quickly up the by-path
that led to the high road above.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lights were burning in the cottage windows
along the village street, and from the little straw
factory on the left-hand side beside the Baptist
chapel, the women were pouring forth into the
road—some gay, some weary, some young, and
some middle-aged, some hurrying to other duties
at home, some loitering to chatter and chaff—most
of them noisy, but all of them busy with work
done and to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl watched them askance, drawing back
under the shadow of the hedgerow, for the moon
had not risen far enough yet to illumine the way,
and the shadows had grown dark. When all had
passed by or dispersed she moved out again, and
stepped up to the door whence they had issued,
and which still stood ajar on to the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>She knocked at it and a woman appeared.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What d’ye want?” said she.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her tone was not unkind but it was sharp—the
tone of a woman with her hands full of work, and
no time for those who have theirs empty. The
girl answered surlily.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“I want work,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, there ain’t none to be ’ad ’ere.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m used to the straw-plaiting and shape-sewing
too,” said the girl more humbly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ye must go elsewhere. We’re full up
’ere,” said the woman, “and shall be for weeks, as
far as I know. ’Ave ye got a reference?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl nodded.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sort of, I s’pose,” said the woman shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’ve got my character,” repeated the girl doggedly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ye must take it elsewhere then,” said the
woman again. “I’m sorry for ye. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And she shut the door quietly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl turned away. She did not speak, nor
even mutter, nor even sigh. But her wan little face
was set and hard.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked down the road towards the open
country, and up it where the cottages clustered,
and she chose the forward way.</p>

<p class='c001'>Wayfarers had almost cleared out of the village
street, for it was quite dark now and bitterly cold;
fires were burning and supper was preparing behind
frosty windows and scanty window-curtains. Here
and there a weary labourer or hurrying house-wife
trudged past, but most people were indoors by
now, most people were at home.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl walked on till she came near to the
public-house near the village-end, where the signpost
points separate fingers up the fork of the road.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>There was a solitary lamp above the post-office
hard by, and she stopped under it and put her hand
in her pocket; the thimble and one halfpenny was
all that she drew out, and she put them back again.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then she looked behind her.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was no one by, no one coming, and she
crept stealthily up to the window of the “public,”
and laid her face against the cold pane, gazing into
the light and brightness and warmth within.</p>

<p class='c001'>There were four or five men clustered round a
table near the fire, and a few more standing at the
bar with a couple of girls.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of them at the table was singing in a loud
voice; he was young—very young—and it was a
good voice, and whatever were the words, the ditty
seemed to please the company.</p>

<p class='c001'>There was a roar of laughter every now and
then, and whenever he stopped a cry of “Go on,
Nat, go on, lad! That’s right,” and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The boy grew more and more excited, and the
men cheered, and the girls clapped their hands and
bent themselves double with laughter, and then the
men laughed again till they coughed and choked
with their merriment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The song was funny, or the point lay in the youth
of the singer.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the girl outside listened.</p>

<p class='c001'>Twice she crept to the door, twice had the knob
in her hand to open and go in, and twice her pluck
seemed to fail. The song stopped, there was a lull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>within; the warmth drew her as a magnet, and
the third time she turned the handle. But she
stood with the door ajar; for on a sudden there
was a sound of chairs moved, of scuffling, of quick
words and quick retorts within; the laughter was
changed to angry altercation, words of which she
could not catch the sense were flung to and fro,
and all at once a man threw the door wide, and the
lad who had been singing was suddenly flung
forth into the road.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl started back at the first noise, then
turned and fled into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the boy stood where they had hurled him,
and the men slammed the door to again behind him.</p>

<p class='c001'>There had been furious words in his mouth when
he had made his ignominious exit, but they had
died suddenly away as though frozen in his throat,
and his limbs, that had struggled to deal revenge
on his foes, had become paralyzed, his hot face had
turned white with fear; he stood as one petrified,
horror-struck, gazing after the thin cotton dress
that flitted away in the gloom.</p>

<p class='c001'>The clamour went on within, some angry, some
grossly laughing, some striving to pacify.</p>

<p class='c001'>The landlord had come down to the door, and
after looking out through the glass, had half opened
it and had glanced out. But the lad had drawn
aside under the eaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why didn’t ’e keep ’is ’ands off what weren’t
’is?” one was saying angrily.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“’E’s gettin’ too cheeky by ’alf,” said another.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, ’e shan’t come into my bar no more,”
declared the landlord decisively, turning back into
the room. “Many’s the time I’ve ’ad a mind to
say so afore, when ’is pore mother used to come a-loiterin’
and waitin’ out there in the cold to try and
fetch ’im ’ome. Mighty little ’e ever cared for ’er,
nor anythin’ as <i>she</i> might ha’ said. But so long as
’e be’aved I ’adn’t the right to turn ’im out. ’E’s
done for ’isself to-night though, and ’e don’t come
in no more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good riddance too,” said one of the girls, settling
her hair that had been loosened in the scuffle; and
the landlord closed the door and drew the curtain
across it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the lad outside made no effort to re-enter.
He did not seem to have heard what had passed
within his earshot.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stood stock-still as they had left him, slowly
rubbing his head with a trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rot,” said he at last, to himself, with a feeble
attempt at a laugh. “Ghosts! There ain’t no sich
things as ghosts!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he took a few steps forward, slowly and
unsteadily, for he was drunk; not, however, in the
direction of the village, and of his rough and lonely
lodging, but between the hedges of the narrow
lane beyond, where the figure had flitted before
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps he had made a mistake; down that lane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>to the left stood the cottage, deserted now, where
he had spent all the years of his life, alone—ever
since he could remember—with the mother whom
he had neglected and ill-treated, whom they all
told him that he had killed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The words buzzed wearily through his aching
brain.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mighty little ’e ever cared for <i>’er</i>, nor anythin’
as <i>she</i> might ha’ said!”</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, it was jolly true too!</p>

<p class='c001'>And his own words, spoken an hour ago, echoed
back again: “Precious little I ever cared for the
women-folk’s jaw!”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was as they said: he had killed her, and he
had never cared for her, he had never mourned her,
he had been drunk the day of her very funeral; he
never missed her now.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stumbled on. The winter twilight had faded
long since, and the moon had slipped behind a
cloud. The lane was quite dark, and he could no
longer make out the swish of the white cotton skirt
which he had fancied he had seen against the hedgerow.
Nevertheless he stumbled on.</p>

<p class='c001'>The old home lay close at hand; the well-known
turning to it struck off here to the left. It stood
in a field a little back from the road; there
was an apple-tree in front of it and behind it,
in the meadow that stretched down to the river,
their cow used to feed in the days before his mother
had had to sell her.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>He stumbled on. Here, by the fence, she was
wont to come down of a morning to see him off to
work, of an evening to welcome him home, and—yes—often
and often o’ night time to watch for
him along the dark and lonely road, when he was
coming home—as he was coming to-night—full of
drink.</p>

<p class='c001'>Home? Yes, it was home <i>then</i>, little as he had
appreciated it.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stopped at the fence, and steadied himself on
its worn and worm-eaten bar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moonlight was leaking through the cloud
again, and dimly lit the thatched roof of the cottage,
whose blank windows and sealed door looked sadly
across the field at him.</p>

<p class='c001'>The latched gate was close to his hand: he
opened it and went in, and the moon shone out
more brightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>The apple-tree was bare, the climbing blush rose
and hardy canary-creeper on the porch were barren
and leafless, the frost lay hard and crisp on the
neglected garden path where he had often seen her
watering the peonies and the sweet-william, or
dressing the hollyhocks in some leisure moment.
It was cold and lifeless now in the cold moonlight,
but he saw it in sunlight and in summer, when the
vegetables were green in the tiny plot of land, when
the few sweet-peas scented the air, or when the
apples were red on the tree.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had never noticed any of it then, but now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>he was sure there had been sweet-peas and hollyhocks,
and that he had seen his mother cutting the
cabbages beyond them.</p>

<p class='c001'>He scratched his head, he could not make himself
out.</p>

<p class='c001'>If it had been daylight no power would have
led him to open that gate and steal into this
forgotten corner, but even so he could not make
himself out.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cold air had been sobering him fast, but he
told himself that he was drunk.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was “jolly true enough” all that they had
said: he hated his home, and had been in it as
little as might be; he had broken his mother’s
heart, and now that she was dead how could it be
that he should either miss her or mourn her? Of
course it could not be.</p>

<p class='c001'>But still he lingered; the drink that was in him
kept him warm, and he forgot the frost and saw the
summer again.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as he looked, the moon left the last of the
cloud behind and shone out brilliantly; and there,
beneath the apple-tree, he saw again the spare
figure of medium height in the faded print gown,
standing still as large as life.</p>

<p class='c001'>His heart seemed to stop beating: there might
be no such things as ghosts, but who was that
figure standing there under the apple-tree?</p>

<p class='c001'>It stirred now. Was it coming to meet him?
He felt a cold sweat break out over his brow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>No, it moved in the opposite direction—across the
grass, past the cottage; it was moving in the
direction of the river.</p>

<p class='c001'>And he followed—as though he were <i>obliged</i> to
follow; slowly at first, as in a dream, but as the
figure quickened its pace—more quickly too.</p>

<p class='c001'>What was it, where was it going?</p>

<p class='c001'>It moved lightly, more lightly than <i>she</i> had done
of late, and now it was hurrying—hurrying across
the crisp meadow, whose damp marshiness the
frost had seized fast—hurrying towards the river.</p>

<p class='c001'>And he hurried too; without thought, blindly.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the moon slid behind a cloud again, all grew
dark, and the spirit—if spirit it was—was lost in
the shadow.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still he hurried; now he seemed to see it here—now
there—he was not sure; perhaps it was
all a dream. But his liquor had never served
him so before—and he had often been worse
drunk.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was near upon turning back, when the moon
fringed the cloud with silver again, and gradually
showed him the figure, as clear as in daylight,
standing upon the bridge that led across to the
road.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked; it was facing him, but though in the
white light and to his heated sense the features
looked ghostly still, and the eyes wild and inhuman,
there was something life-like about the
creature, and even as he looked, it threw up its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>arms and took one leap forwards and downwards
into the water.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he awoke; he was no longer drunk. He
did not stop to think—he dashed forward, stripping
off his coat as he ran, and pushed through the
reeds on the river bank, and plunged into the
stream.</p>

<p class='c001'>The cold of the water was horrible—it took his
breath away. But, as luck would have it, the
stream here was not deep but swift, and it carried
the body towards him; he clutched it, caught it,
and, half swimming, half wading, brought it, in
little more than a minute, safely on to the
bank.</p>

<p class='c001'>His teeth were chattering, but it was not with
fright now; he had forgotten that he had once
fancied this to have been a ghost.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a girl, and it lay motionless.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stripped off the shoddy black jacket and
wrung the water from it, then tried to wring it
from the poor, clinging cotton skirts, that were
stiffening with frost in the biting air; after that he
chafed the cold body, and took off the worn boots
and emptied the water out of them; and then he
searched in his pockets, and drew forth a half-pint
flat bottle, which he put to her lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>A pungent odour of common spirit filled the
air.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s lucky I left a drop,” he murmured to himself,
and a keener satisfaction than he had ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>experienced even from drinking it himself filled
him as he watched the colour slowly come back
to the ashen face. But it took a deal of rubbing
again before the eyes opened, before any breath
seemed to come struggling through those pale lips.
Several times he was for leaving her and running
for assistance, because he was frightened.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the village was far behind, and he was afraid
she might die while he was gone; so he waited
with a beating heart, and at last she moved and
tried to speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“D’ye feel better now?” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>She nodded feebly.</p>

<p class='c001'>He passed his hand under her head and set her
up against his knee.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the head drooped again, and she began to
shiver.</p>

<p class='c001'>“She didn’t ought to be ’ere,” he muttered to
himself; “it’s freezin’ plaguey ’ard, and she soaked
through.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“D’ye think ye can walk?” said he to her
ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>She did not answer, and he scratched his head.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then suddenly an inspiration came to him. He
knew a way into the old home by the back; it
would be empty and cheerless, but it would be
safer than the frosty night air, and maybe he
might be lucky enough to find a morsel of old
wood with which he might light a bit of a fire.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was worth trying, and without more ado he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>took the poor thing in his arms, and stumbled up
the meadow with her.</p>

<p class='c001'>She was light enough in all conscience, and she
lay passive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, the rotten old door was broken, as he last
remembered it, and he pushed it open and bore
her in. The place was bare, but he lay her down
beside the cold hearth, with her head against the
chimney-corner, and ran to the outhouse. The luck
was with him to-night as it was not wont to be:
there were some remnants of brushwood scattered
about; he swept together a handful, and with the
matches that luckily were safe and dry in the
pocket of the coat he had cast off, he soon kindled
a bit of a blaze in the forsaken old dwelling-room.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he hung her jacket to dry and set to work
again to rub her body.</p>

<p class='c001'>The warmth revived her, she crept as close as
she could to it, shivering still.</p>

<p class='c001'>He took out the bottle again, his best notion of
help; but she shook her head at the sight of it, and
a sudden idea struck him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When did ye ’ave yer food last?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>She did not answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Maybe ye’re ’ungry?” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>And as she was still silent, he turned out his
pockets again, and produced a broken bit of dry
crust.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s all I left o’ my dinner,” he said, “but it’ll
stay yer stomach till ye can get ’ome.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>She let him put it into her hand, but she did
not eat.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It’s a queer thing,” said he ruminatingly,
“women don’t seem to ’ave no pecker when they
ain’t fit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She shivered again.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, look ’ere,” said he, drawing out the spirit
bottle once more, “ye’ve got to have another go
at this or I’m damned, and then ye’ve got to eat
that crust.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He forced it on her, and she submitted, and then
he added: “And as soon as ye can walk ye ought
to go ’ome. Ye’ll catch yer death in them damp
clothes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She was silent, and he stood watching her
nibbling the crust, while he took a pull at the
spirit himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>A notion seemed to occur to him, and he paused
with the flask in his hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What did ye go and jump into the water for?”
he said at last, perhaps thinking that what she
<i>wanted</i> was to “catch her death.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And as still she was dumb, he added another to
the string of his questions: “Where d’ye live?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then at last she answered.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nowhere,” said she bitterly.</p>

<p class='c001'>He started.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What, ain’t ye got no ’ome?” asked he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>He whistled.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“No more ’aven’t I,” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor yet no mother?” he added in a low voice
after a while.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” she said.</p>

<p class='c001'>He looked round the ghostly, deserted old home—at
the figure huddled by the hearth where
another had been wont to cook his meals, at the
empty window where a familiar chair had once
stood.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more ’aven’t I,” he said. And after a pause
he added with a half laugh, “P’raps ye ’aven’t even
got no work?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” she replied for the third time.</p>

<p class='c001'>And he laughed outright as he added again:
“No more ’aven’t I!”</p>

<p class='c001'>He walked to the window, and she struggled to
her feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I guess ye <i>wanted</i> to catch yer death,” he
muttered.</p>

<p class='c001'>She stood hanging over the blaze that was
beginning to flicker down, and he with his back
to her at the window gazing out into the garden,
where the moonlight lay white and hard on the
frosted walk and on the dreary, empty potato patch.</p>

<p class='c001'>If his mother had been up-stairs she would have
known what to do now. She had always known
what to do somehow. And suddenly there crossed
his mind a vision of her taking into the house a
poor starved dog that had been hooted down the
road by the village boys.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Yes, she would have known what to do. But
she was not up-stairs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I s’pose there’s plenty as wouldn’t mind a-catchin’
their death,” murmured he, half to himself.
“Folk as ’ave made a mess of it, or as ’aven’t got
no one to work for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl at the fire threw up her head almost
proudly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I ain’t what yer might think,” she said. “I
ain’t done nothin’ wus than starve. They turned
me off at the factory, but it weren’t no fault o’
mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Weren’t ye drunk?” asked the boy simply.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her wan face flushed purple.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Drunk!” said she. “I ain’t never been drunk
in my life.” And she moved from him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then he flushed too—ashamed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I beg yer pardon,” he stammered. “It’s what
they turn me off for—but o’ course ... I beg yer
pardon!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Granted,” said she. “It’s likely ye should think
so. But my dead mother might see me and
welcome, for all the ’arm I’ve a-done, and that’s
the truth!”</p>

<p class='c001'>He shivered at the words and looked round.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish I could say as much,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>She looked at him and came a step nearer, but
the sob that had risen in her throat at his unintentional
insult had turned to a fit of coughing, and
she could not speak.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>He turned quickly to the hearth, and kicked the
bits of stick together with his foot; but there was
no more life in them, they were burnt out, and
there were no more.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’re catchin’ yer death o’ cold,” repeated he
testily. “I dursen’t advise ye to stop ’ere no
longer. Let me show ye the way to the next
village, if ye’re a stranger to the place. Leastways,
I think there’s a parcel o’ ’ouses afore ye come to
it, where ye might get a night’s lodgin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She laughed harshly, and he stopped—confused.</p>

<p class='c001'>He guessed her meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>“’Aven’t ye got no money?” asked he after a
minute or two, timidly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No,” she answered, struggling fiercely with tears
again. “I’ve been out o’ work this three weeks.
Ye’d ha’ done best to leave me where I was!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t say that,” said he quite gently. “The
luck’s bound to turn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She stood quietly wiping a tear now and then,
and he beside her turning his hand round and
round in his breeches pocket.</p>

<p class='c001'>At last he pulled the hand out and held it
towards her: there was a silver coin in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’d best take it,” said he sheepishly. “I ’ad
my week’s wage to-day, though they <i>’ave</i> a-turned
me off, and I can spare it nicely. It’ll get ye a
bed and a bit o’ supper anyways.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her face flushed and her lip quivered again.
But she took it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“Ye’re very kind,” said she. “I ought to thank
ye, I’m sure. If mother was alive...”</p>

<p class='c001'>Her voice shook, and she didn’t finish the
sentence.</p>

<p class='c001'>He stepped to the hearth and took up her
wretched little jacket that had lain there a-drying,
handing it to her clumsily. Her last words echoed
in his ears.</p>

<p class='c001'>She took the jacket, and pushed her poor, thin
arms into its shrunken sleeves; it was damp still,
and it would not meet, even across her narrow
chest.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The luck’ll turn,” he repeated awkwardly. “It
allers do turn—one way or t’other. Ye must try
for work again at Hoo, yonder. There’s another
factory there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Seems as though God A’mighty did ought to
give me another chance,” she said with a sigh, “if
it were on’y for this. For I shan’t be able to pay
ye back else.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He had opened the cranky door, and they had
passed out into the moonlit frostiness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Never think o’ that,” said he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shall though,” she declared. “Ye must show
me your ’ome, so as I shall know where to find ye
to pay it back agin—when I do get work.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My ’ome!” echoed he.</p>

<p class='c001'>And he turned and looked at the deserted
cottage with its closed, silent windows.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the chimney a faint line of smoke from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the remnants of the fire that he had lit was stealing
up straight into the calm, cold air—ascending
steadily, like incense, into the sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>He caught his breath.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This’d be the best place,” he said. “I’ll come
’ere next Saturday night and see if ye’re anywheres
about. I’d like to ’ear ’ow ye was a-gettin’ on,
but I don’t want the money.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They had crossed the garden by this time, and
stood at the gate.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shan’t rest till I can bring it ye though,” said
she. “I ’aven’t never borrowed from nobody
afore. That was why ... <i>you know</i>...! P’r’aps
I didn’t ought to ha’ took it now. But it seemed
as though ... well, it seemed as though, if yer
pulled me out o’ the water, I’d <i>got</i> to keep the life
in me! I couldn’t ha’ felt like taking it from no
one else, I think. But there, ye’re a good sort, and
I’ll owe it to you. But I’ll pay you—s’elp me God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She shoved the gate open and went out into the
road, he following.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A good sort!” He “a good sort!” An hour
ago he would ... no, not have <i>laughed</i>; he would
have sworn, to say the very least of it, at any one
who had dared to say such a thing; for he would
have known they meant it as an insult. But he
neither laughed nor swore at this woman. He
simply stood still and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c001'>The clock in the church steeple up the stream
struck ten.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Ye’ll ’ave to look sharp,” said he, “or no one
won’t take ye in to-night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>She was shivering in the bitter air, and she could
walk but slowly; still she walked alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>He moved a few steps beside her, then stopped.</p>

<p class='c001'>A sudden instinct that he could not have defined
bade him send her on her way alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ye’ll do now,” said he, “won’t ye? Them’s
the cottages—up there to yer right. You knock
at the first door—there’s an old woman lives there—she
used to be mother’s chum. She’d take ye
in, if ’twas for nothing, but that ... if she only
knowed....”</p>

<p class='c001'>Nat blushed, and he was not in the habit of
blushing, and stammered as he was not in the
habit of stammering, for he did not know how to
finish his sentence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, anyways ye’ve got the money,” concluded
he, “and if it comes to that—there’s a ‘public’ at
Hoo where they lets out beds. So you look
sharp.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good-night; and thank ye,” said the girl.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good-night,” answered he.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I shan’t forget what you done for me,” said
she.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, stow that,” he said.</p>

<p class='c001'>He watched her as she moved slowly along:
watched her till she had turned up the lane to the
cluster of cottages, and waited to see if she would
come back on it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>He put his hand in his pocket to feel for his
pipe and matches; the matches were gone, and
he remembered that he had used them to light
the fire—yonder in his old home, on the hearth
where his mother had been wont to boil the pot
for his supper.</p>

<p class='c001'>He turned and looked again.</p>

<p class='c001'>The trail of smoke from the old chimney was
thinner and fainter—but it was still there—ascending
softly and steadily.</p>

<p class='c001'>His heart was lighter at the sight of it, and he
whistled gently to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The girl had not reappeared; she must be
housed and safe by now.</p>

<p class='c001'>He set his face back whence he had come, and
went on his way content.</p>

<p class='c001'>A little bird twittered pitifully in the frost-bound
hedge as he passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>He searched for the place and found it; it was
dying of cold and hunger.</p>

<p class='c001'>He put it in his warm bosom within his coat;
he thought that he would feed it when he got in,
and that perhaps he might bring it back to life.</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘With the exception of <i>The Scapegoat</i>, this is unquestionably
the finest and most dramatic of Mr. Hall Caine’s novels ... <i>The
Manxman</i> goes very straight to the roots of human passion and emotion. It
is a remarkable book, throbbing with human interest.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Guardian.</b>—‘A story of exceptional power and thorough originality.
The greater portion of it is like a Greek tragic drama, in the intensity of its
interest, and the depth of its overshadowing gloom.... But this tragedy is
merely a telling background for a series of brilliant sketches of men and
manners, of old-world customs, and forgotten ways of speech which still
linger in the Isle of Man.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘A singularly powerful and picturesque piece of work,
extraordinarily dramatic.... Taken altogether, <i>The Manxman</i> cannot fail
to enhance Mr. Hall Caine’s reputation. It is a most powerful book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘If possible, Mr. Hall Caine’s work, <i>The Manxman</i>,
is more marked by passion, power, and brilliant local colouring than its
predecessors.... It has a grandeur as well as strength, and the picturesque
features and customs of a delightful country are vividly painted.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘Over and above the absorbing interest of the story, which
never flags, the book is full of strength, of vivid character sketches, and
powerful word-painting, all told with a force and knowledge of local colour.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Queen.</b>—‘<i>The Manxman</i> is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable
books of the century. It will be read and re-read, and take its place in the
literary inheritance of the English-speaking nations.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘<i>The Manxman</i> is a contribution to literature,
and the most fastidious critic would give in exchange for it a wilderness
of that deciduous trash which our publishers call fiction.... It is not possible
to part from <i>The Manxman</i> with anything but a warm tribute of approval.’—<span class='sc'>Edmund
Gosse.</span></p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Christian World.</b>—‘There is a great fascination in being present,
as it were, at the birth of a classic; and a classic undoubtedly <i>The Manxman</i>
is... He who reads <i>The Manxman</i> feels that he is reading a book which
will be read and re-read by very many thousands with human tears and
human laughter.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Mr. T. P. O’Connor, in the ‘Sun.’</b>—‘This is a very fine and great
story—one of the finest and greatest of our time.... Mr. Hall Caine reaches
heights which are attained only by the greatest masters of fiction.... I think
of the great French writer, Stendhal, at the same moment as the great
English writer.... In short, you feel what Mr. Howells said of Tolstoi,
“This is not like life; it is life.”... He belongs to that small minority of
the Great Elect of Literature.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘It is not too much to say that it is the most powerful
story that has been written in the present generation.... The love of Pete,
his simple-mindedness, his sufferings when he has lost Kate, are painted with
a master-hand.... It is a work of genius.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>Mr. Gladstone.</b>—‘<i>The Bondman</i> is a work of which I recognise the
freshness, vigour, and sustained interest, no less than its integrity of aim.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Times.</b>—‘It is impossible to deny originality and rude power to this
saga, impossible not to admire its forceful directness, and the colossal
grandeur of its leading characters.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘The language of <i>The Bondman</i> is full of nervous,
graphic, and poetical English; its interest never flags, and its situations and
descriptions are magnificent. It is a splendid novel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘This is the best book that Mr. Hall Caine has yet
written, and it reaches a level to which fiction very rarely attains.... We
are, in fact so loth to let such good work be degraded by the title of
“novel” that we are almost tempted to consider its claim to rank as a prose
epic.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘Mr. Hall Caine has in this work placed himself
beyond the front rank of the novelists of the day. He has produced a story
which, for the ingenuity of its plot, for its literary excellence, for its delineations
of human passions, and for its intensely powerful dramatic scenes, is
distinctly ahead of all the fictional literature of our time, and fit to rank with
the most powerful fictional writing of the past century.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘Crowded with incidents.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Observer.</b>—‘Many of the descriptions are picturesque and powerful....
As fine in their way as anything in modern literature.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Liverpool Mercury.</b>—‘A story which will be read, not by his contemporaries
alone, but by later generations, so long as its chief features—high
emotion, deep passion, exquisite poetry, and true pathos—have power to
delight and to touch the heart.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘It is the product of a strenuous and sustained
imaginative effort far beyond the power of any every-day story-teller.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scots Observer.</b>—‘In none of his previous works has he approached
the splendour of idealism which flows through <i>The Bondman</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘A remarkable story, painted with vigour
and brilliant effect.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘A striking and highly dramatic piece of
fiction.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘The book abounds in pages of great force and
beauty, and there is a touch of almost Homeric power in its massive and
grand simplicity.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Liverpool Post.</b>—‘Graphic, dramatic, pathetic, heroic, full of
detail, crowded with incident and inspired by a noble purpose.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Yorkshire Post.</b>—‘A book of lasting interest.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><b>Mr. Gladstone writes</b>:—‘I congratulate you upon <i>The Scapegoat</i> as a work
of art, and especially upon the noble and skilfully drawn character of Israel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Mr. Walter Besant, in ‘The Author.’</b>—‘Nearly every year there stands
out a head and shoulders above its companions one work which promises to
make the year memorable. This year a promise of lasting vitality is distinctly
made by Mr. Hall Caine’s <i>Scapegoat</i>. It is a great book, great in conception
and in execution; a strong book, strong in situation and in character; and
a human book, human in its pathos, its terror, and its passion.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Times.</b>—‘In our judgment it excels in dramatic force all the Author’s
previous efforts. For grace and touching pathos Naomi is a character which
any romancist in the world might be proud to have created, and the tale of
her parents’ despair and hopes, and of her own development, confers upon
<i>The Scapegoat</i> a distinction which is matchless of its kind.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Guardian.</b>—‘Mr. Hall Caine is undoubtedly master of a style which
is peculiarly his own. He is in a way a Rembrandt among novelists. His
figures, striking and powerful rather than beautiful, stand out, with the
ruggedness of their features developed and accentuated, from a background
of the deepest gloom.... Every sentence contains a thought, and every word
of it is balanced and arranged to accumulate the intensity of its force.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘It is a delightful story to read.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘Israel ben Oliel is the third of a series of the most
profoundly conceived characters in modern fiction.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—‘This is the best novel which Mr. Caine has
yet produced.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘The lifelike renderings of the varied situations,
the gradual changes in a noble character, hardened and lowered by the
world’s cruel usage, and returning at last to its original grandeur, can only
be fully appreciated by a perusal of the book as a whole.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Anti-Jacobin.</b>—‘It is, in truth, a romance of fine poetic quality.
Israel Ben Oliel, the central figure of the tale, is sculptured rather than drawn:
a character of grand outline. A nobler piece of prose than the death of
Ruth we have seldom met with.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘The new story will rank with Mr. Hall Caine’s previous
productions. Nay, it will in some respects rank above them. It will take
its place by the side of the Hebrew histories in the Apocrypha. It is nobly
and manfully written. It stirs the blood and kindles the imagination.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scottish Leader.</b>—‘<i>The Scapegoat</i> is a masterpiece.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Truth.</b>—‘Mr. Hall Caine has been winning his way slowly, but surely,
and securely, I think also, to fame. You must by all means read his
absorbing Moorish romance, <i>The Scapegoat</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Jewish World.</b>—‘Only one who had studied Moses could have
drawn that grand portrait of Israel ben Oliel.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘It is so full of interest, and the characters are so
eccentrically humorous yet true, that one feels inclined to pardon all its
faults, and give oneself up to unreserved enjoyment of it.... The twins
Angelica and Diavolo, young barbarians, utterly devoid of all respect, conventionality,
or decency, are among the most delightful and amusing children
in fiction.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘The adventures of Diavolo and Angelica—the
"heavenly twins"—are delightfully funny. No more original children were
ever put into a book. Their audacity, unmanageableness, and genius for
mischief—in none of which qualities, as they are here shown, is there any
taint of vice—are refreshing; and it is impossible not to follow, with very
keen interest, the progress of these youngsters.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘Everybody ought to read it, for it is an inexhaustible
source of refreshing and highly stimulating entertainment.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘There is much powerful and some beautiful writing in
this strange book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Westminster Gazette.</b>—‘Sarah Grand ... has put enough observation,
humour, and thought into this book to furnish forth half-a-dozen
ordinary novels.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Punch.</b>—‘The Twins themselves are a creation: the epithet “Heavenly”
for these two mischievous little fiends is admirable.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Queen.</b>—‘There is a touch of real genius in <i>The Heavenly Twins</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Guardian.</b>—‘Exceptionally brilliant in dialogue, and dealing with
modern society life, this book has a purpose—to draw out and emancipate
women.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Lady.</b>—‘Apart from its more serious interest, the book should take
high rank on its literary merits alone. Its pages are brimful of good things,
and more than one passage, notably the episode of “The Boy and the
Tenor,” is a poem complete in itself, and worthy of separate publication.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Examiner.</b>—‘As surely as <i>Tess of the d’Urbervilles</i>
swept all before it last year, so surely has Sarah Grand’s <i>Heavenly Twins</i>
provoked the greatest attention and comment this season. It is a most
daringly original work.... Sarah Grand is a notable Woman’s Righter,
but her book is the one asked for at Mudie’s, suburban, and seaside libraries,
and discussed at every hotel table in the kingdom. The episode of the
“Tenor and the Boy” is of rare beauty, and is singularly delicate and at the
same time un-English in treatment.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The New York Critic.</b>—‘It is written in an epigrammatic style, and,
besides its cleverness, has the great charm of freshness, enthusiasm, and
poetic feeling.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘Sarah Grand’s <i>Ideala</i>.... A clever book in
itself, is especially interesting when read in the light of her later works.
Standing alone, it is remarkable as the outcome of an earnest mind seeking
in good faith the solution of a difficult and ever present problem.... <i>Ideala</i>
is original and somewhat daring.... The story is in many ways delightful
and thought-suggesting.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘When Sarah Grand came before the public in
1888 with <i>Ideala</i>, she consciously and firmly laid her finger on one of the
keynotes of the age.... We welcome an edition that will place this minute
and careful study of an interesting question within reach of a wider circle of
readers.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Liverpool Mercury.</b>—‘The book is a wonderful one—an evangel
for the fair sex, and at once an inspiration and a comforting companion, to
which thoughtful womanhood will recur again and again.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘<i>Ideala</i> has attained the honour of a fifth
edition.... The stir created by <i>The Heavenly Twins</i>, the more recent
work by the same authoress, Madame Sarah Grand, would justify this step.
<i>Ideala</i> can, however, stand on its own merits.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Yorkshire Post.</b>—‘As a psychological study the book cannot fail to
be of interest to many readers.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Birmingham Gazette.</b>—‘Madame Sarah Grand thoroughly deserves
her success. Ideala, the heroine, is a splendid conception, and her opinions
are noble.... The book is not one to be forgotten.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Woman’s Herald.</b>—‘One naturally wishes to know something of
the woman for whose sake Lord Downe remained a bachelor. It must be
confessed that at first <i>Ideala</i> is a little disappointing. She is strikingly
original.... As the story advances one forgets these peculiarities, and can
find little but sympathy and admiration for the many noble qualities of a
very complex character.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Englishman.</b>—‘Madame Sarah Grand’s work is far from being a
common work. Ideala is a clever young woman of great capabilities and
noble purposes.... The <a id='corrad.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='orginality'>originality</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_ad.1'><ins class='correction' title='orginality'>originality</ins></a></span> of the book does not lie in the plot, but
in the authoress’s power to see and to describe the finer shades of a character
which is erratic and impetuous, but above all things truly womanly.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘Six stories by the gifted writer who still chooses
to be known to the public at large by the pseudonym of “<b>Sarah Grand</b>.”
In regard to them it is sufficient to say that they display all the qualities,
stylistic, humorous, and pathetic, that have placed the author of <i>Ideala</i> and
<i>The Heavenly Twins</i> in the very front rank of contemporary novelists.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘Brief studies of character, sympathetic, and suggesting that
“Sarah Grand” can do something more than startle by her unconventionality
and boldness.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Ladies’ Pictorial.</b>—‘If the volume does not achieve even greater
popularity than Sarah Grand’s former works, it will be a proof that fashion,
not intrinsic merit, has a great deal to do with the success of a book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘All are eminently entertaining.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Spectator.</b>—‘Insight into, and general sympathy with widely
differing phases of humanity, coupled with power to reproduce what is seen,
with vivid distinct strokes, that rivet the attention, are qualifications for
work of the kind contained in <i>Our Manifold Nature</i> which Sarah Grand
evidently possesses in a high degree.... All these studies, male and female
alike, are marked by humour, pathos, fidelity to life, and power to recognise
in human nature the frequent recurrence of some apparently incongruous
and remote trait, which, when at last it becomes visible, helps to a comprehension
of what might otherwise be inexplicable.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘In <i>Our Manifold Nature</i> Sarah Grand is seen at her
best. How good that is can only be known by those who read for themselves
this admirable little volume. In freshness of conception and originality
of treatment these stories are delightful, full of force and piquancy, whilst
the studies of character are carried out with equal firmness and delicacy.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Guardian.</b>—‘<i>Our Manifold Nature</i> is a clever book. Sarah Grand
has the power of touching common things, which, if it fails to make them
“rise to touch the spheres,” renders them exceedingly interesting.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘Unstinted praise is deserved by the Irish story,
“Boomellen,” a tale remarkable both for power and pathos.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Court Journal.</b>—‘<i>Our Manifold Nature</i> is simply fall of good things,
and it is essentially a book to buy as well as to read.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Birmingham Gazette.</b>—‘Mrs. Grand has genuine power. She
analyses keenly.... Her humour is good, and her delineation of character
one of her strongest points. The book is one to be read, studied, and acted
upon.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</div>
    <div class='c000'>AND</div>
    <div class='c000'>LLOYD OSBOURNE</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘This is a novel of sensation. But the episodes and
incidents, although thrilling enough, are consistently subordinated to sensationalism
of character.... There is just enough of the coral reef and the
palm groves, of cerulean sky and pellucid water, to indicate rather than to
present the local colouring. Yet when he dashes in a sketch it is done to
perfection.... We see the scene vividly unrolled before us.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘The story is full of strong scenes, depicted
with a somewhat lavish use of violet pigments, such as, perhaps, the stirring
situations demand. Here and there, however, are purple patches, in which
Mr. Stevenson shows all his cunning literary art—the description of the
coral island, for instance.... Some intensely graphic and dramatic pages
delineate the struggle which causes, and a final scene ... concludes this
strange fragment from the wild life of the South Sea.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘The book takes your imagination and
attention captive from the first chapter—nay, from the first paragraph—and it
does not set them free till the last word has been read.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘Mr. Stevenson gives such vitality to his characters,
and so clear an outlook upon the strange quarter of the world to which he
takes us, that when we reach the end of the story, we come back to civilisation
with a start of surprise, and a moment’s difficulty in realising that we
have not been actually away from it.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘We are swept along without a pause on the
current of the animated and vigorous narrative. Each incident and adventure
is told with that incomparable keenness of vision which is Mr. Stevenson’s
greatest charm as a story-teller.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘It is brilliantly invented, and it is not less
brilliantly told. There is not a dull sentence in the whole run of it. And
the style is fresh, alert, full of surprises—in fact, is very good latter-day
Stevenson indeed.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘It is amazingly clever, full of that extraordinary knowledge
of human nature which makes certain creations of Mr. Stevenson’s pen
far more real to us than persons we have met in the flesh. Grisly the book
undoubtedly is, with a strength and a vigour of description hardly to be
matched in the language.... But it is just because the book is so extraordinarily
good that it ought to be better, ought to be more of a serious whole
than a mere brilliant display of fireworks, though each firework display has
more genius in it than is to be found in ninety-nine out of every hundred
books supposed to contain that rare quality.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘Boldly conceived, probing some of the darkest
depths of the human soul, the tale has a vigour and breadth of touch which
have been surpassed in none of Mr. Stevenson’s previous works.... We
do not, of course, know how much Mr. Osbourne has contributed to the tale,
but there is no chapter in it which any author need be unwilling to acknowledge,
or which is wanting in vivid interest.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>Morning Post.</b>—‘The merits of the book are great. Its range of observation
is wide; its sketches of character are frequently admirably drawn....
It is extremely refreshing, after a surfeit of recent fiction of the prevalent type,
to welcome a really clever work by a writer who is certainly not hampered
by conventional prejudice.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Queen.</b>—‘It is impossible to deny the greatness of a book like <i>The
Master</i>, a veritable human document, in which the characters do exactly as
they would in life.... I venture to say that Matt himself is one of the most
striking and original characters in our fiction, and I have not the least doubt
that <i>The Master</i> will always be reckoned one of our classics.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘It is a powerful and masterly piece of work....
Quite the best novel of the year.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Literary World.</b>—‘In <i>The Master</i>, Mr. Zangwill has eclipsed all his
previous work. This strong and striking story of patience and passion, of
sorrow and success, of art, ambition, and vain gauds, is genuinely powerful
in its tragedy, and picturesque in its completeness.... The work, thoroughly
wholesome in tone, is of sterling merit, and strikes a truly tragic chord, which
leaves a deep impression upon the mind.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Jewish World.</b>—‘For a novel to be a work that shall live, and not merely
please the passing taste of a section of the public, it must palpitate with the
truth of human experience and human feeling.... Such a novel is <i>The
Master</i>, Mr. Zangwill’s latest, and assuredly one of his best works. Interest
in the story is sustained from beginning to end. From the first page to the
last we get a series of vivid pictures that make us feel, as well as understand,
not only the personality and environment of his characters, but the motives
that compel, like fate, their words and actions.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Leeds Mercury.</b>—‘<i>The Master</i> is impassioned and powerful, and, in our
judgment, is vastly superior to <i>Children of the Ghetto</i>. From the first page to
the last the book is quick with life, and not less quick surprises.... The
impression which the book leaves is deep and distinct, and the power, from
start to finish, of such a delineation of life is unmistakable.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Liverpool Mercury.</b>—‘The accomplished author of <i>Children of the Ghetto</i>
has given us in <i>The Master</i> a book written with marvellous skill, and characterised
by vivid imaginative power. It is not a volume to be taken up and
despatched in a leisure evening, but one to be studied and enjoyed in many
an hour of quiet, or to be read aloud in the family circle, when the toils of
the day have given place to retirement and peace.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘From whatever point of view we regard it, it is a remarkable
book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘The chief interest of the book lies in the wonderful
description of the Whitechapel Jews. The vividness and force with which
Mr. Zangwill brings before us the strange and uncouth characters with which
he has peopled his book are truly admirable.... Admirers of Mr. Zangwill’s
fecund wit will not fail to find flashes of it in these pages.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘Altogether we are not aware of any such minute,
graphic, and seemingly faithful picture of the Israel of nineteenth century
London.... The book has taken hold of us.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Spectator.</b>—‘Esther Ansell, Raphael Leon, Mrs. Henry Goldsmith,
Reb Shemuel, and the rest, are living creations.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘A strong and remarkable book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘To ignore this book is not to know the East
End Jew.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Guardian.</b>—‘A novel such as only our own day could produce. A
masterly study of a complicated psychological problem in which every factor
is handled with such astonishing dexterity and intelligence that again and
again we are tempted to think a really good book has come into our hands.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Graphic.</b>—‘Absolutely fascinating. Teaches how closely akin are
laughter and tears.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘A moving panorama of Jewish life, full of truth, full
of sympathy, vivid in the setting forth, and occasionally most brilliant. Such
a book as this has the germs of a dozen novels. A book to read, to keep, to
ponder over, to remember.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>W. Archer in ‘The World.’</b>—‘The most powerful and fascinating book
I have read for many a long day.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Land and Water.</b>—‘The most wonderful multi-coloured and brilliant
description. Dickens has never drawn characters of more abiding individuality.
An exceeding beautiful chapter is the honeymoon of the Hyams.
Charles Kingsley in one of his books makes for something of the same sort.
But his idea is not half so tender and faithful, nor his handling anything like
so delicate and natural.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Andrew Lang in ‘Longman’s Magazine.’</b>—‘Almost every kind of
reader will find <i>Children of the Ghetto</i> interesting.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>T. P. O’Connor in ‘The Weekly Sun.’</b>—‘Apart altogether from its
great artistic merits, from its clear portraits, its subtle and skilful analysis of
character, its pathos and its humour, this book has, in my mind, an immense
interest as a record of a generation that has passed and of struggles that are
yet going on.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘The best Jewish novel ever written.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘Several of Mr. Zangwill’s contemporary Ghetto characters
have already become almost classical; but in <i>The King of Schnorrers</i>
he goes back to the Jewish community of the eighteenth century for the
hero of his principal story; and he is indeed a stupendous hero ... anyhow,
he is well named the king of beggars. The illustrations, by Phil May, add
greatly to the attraction of the book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—‘Mr. Zangwill has created a new figure in
fiction, and a new type of humour. The entire series of adventures is a
triumphant progress.... Humour of a rich and active character pervades
the delightful history of Manasses. Mr. Zangwill’s book is altogether very
good reading. It is also very cleverly illustrated by Phil May and other
artists.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘Of Mr. Zangwill’s versatility there is ample
proof in this new volume of stories.... More noticeable and welcome to
us, as well as more characteristic of the author, are the fresh additions he has
made to his long series of studies of Jewish life.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘<i>The King of Schnorrers</i> is a very fascinating
story. Mr. Zangwill returns to the Ghetto, and gives us a quaint old-world
picture as a most appropriate setting for his picturesque hero, the beggar-king....
Good as the story of the arch-schnorrer is there is perhaps an
even better “Yiddish” tale in this book. This is “Flutter-Duck.”...
Let us call attention to the excellence, as mere realistic vivid description, of
the picture of the room and atmosphere and conditions in which Flutter-Duck
and her circle dwelt; there is something of Dickens in this.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘<i>The King of Schnorrers</i>, like <i>Children of the
Ghetto</i>, depicts the habits and characteristics of Israel in London with painstaking
elaborateness and apparent verisimilitude. <i>The King of Schnorrers</i> is
a character-sketch which deals with the manners and customs of native and
foreign Jews as they “lived and had their being” in the London of a century
and a quarter ago.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘It is a beautiful story. <i>The King of Schnorrers</i>
is that great rarity—an entirely new thing, that is as good as it is new.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.-</b>-‘On the whole, the book does justice to Mr.
Zangwill’s rapidly-growing reputation, and the character of Manasseh ought
to live.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘The exuberant and even occasionally overpowering
humour of Mr. Zangwill is at his highest mark in his new volume, <i>The

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Cambridge (University) Review.</b>—‘That the book will have
readers in a future generation we do not doubt, for there is much in it that is
of lasting merit.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Graphic.</b>—‘It might be worth the while of some industrious and
capable person with plenty of leisure to reproduce in a volume of reasonable
size the epigrams and other good things witty and serious which <i>The Premier
and the Painter</i> contains. There are plenty of them, and many are worth
noting and remembering,’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘The satire hits all round with much impartiality;
while one striking situation succeeds another till the reader is altogether
dazzled. The story is full of life and “go” and brightness, and will well
repay perusal.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘In spite of its close print and its five hundred pages
<i>The Premier and the Painter</i> is not very difficult to read. To speak of it,
however, is difficult. It is the sort of book that demands yet defies quotation
for one thing; and for another it is the sort of book the description of which
as “very clever” is at once inevitable and inadequate. In some ways it is
original enough to be a law unto itself, and withal as attractive in its
whimsical, wrong-headed way, as at times it is tantalising, bewildering, even
tedious. The theme is politics and politicians, and the treatment, while for
the most part satirical and prosaic, is often touched with sentiment, and
sometimes even with a fantastic kind of poetry. The several episodes of the
story are wildly fanciful in themselves and are clumsily connected; but the
streak of humorous cynicism which shows through all of them is both curious
and pleasing. Again, it has to be claimed for the author that—as is shown
to admiration by his presentation of the excellent Mrs. Dawe and her cookshop—he
is capable, when he pleases, of insight and observation of a high
order, and therewith of a masterly sobriety of tone. But he cannot be
depended upon for the length of a single page; he seeks his effects and his
material when and where he pleases. In some respects his method is not,
perhaps, altogether unlike Lord Beaconsfield’s. To our thinking, however,
he is strong enough to go alone, and to go far.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘Undeniably clever, though with a somewhat mixed and
eccentric cleverness.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘The story is described as a “fantastic romance,”
and, indeed, fantasy reigns supreme from the first to the last of its pages. It
relates the history of our time with humour and well-aimed sarcasm. All the
most prominent characters of the day, whether political or otherwise, come in
for notice. The identity of the leading politicians is but thinly veiled, while
many celebrities appear <i>in propriâ personâ</i>. Both the “Premier” and
“Painter” now and again find themselves in the most critical situations.
Certainly this is not a story that he who runs may read, but it is cleverly
original, and often lightened by bright flashes of wit.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘The fidelity of his portraiture is remarkable, and
it has rarely appeared to so much advantage as in this brilliant novel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—‘<i>The Countess Radna</i>, which its author not
unjustly describes as “an unpretending tale,” avoids, by the grace of its style
and the pleasant accuracy of its characterisation, any suspicion of boredom.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘<i>The Countess Radna</i> contains many of the qualities
that make a story by this writer welcome to the critic. It is caustic in style,
the character drawing is clear, the talk natural; the pages are strewn with
good things worth quoting.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘In style, skill in construction, and general “go,” it is

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘As a whole, the book is decidedly well written, while
it is undeniably interesting. It is bright and wholesome: the work in fact
of a gentleman and a man who knows the world about which he writes.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘The novel, like all Mr. Norris’s work is an excessively
clever piece of work, and the author never for a moment allows his
grasp of his plot and his characters to slacken.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Gentlewoman.</b>—‘Mr. Norris is a practised hand at his craft. He
can write bright dialogue and clear English, too.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘His last novel, <i>The Countess Radna</i>, is an excellent
sample of his style. The plot is simple enough. But the story
holds the attention and insists upon being read; and it is scarcely possible
to say anything more favourable of a work of fiction.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘The story, in which there is more than a spice of
modern life romance, is an excellent study of the problem of mixed marriage.
The book is one of good healthy reading, and reveals a fine broad view of life
and human nature.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘This is an unusually fresh and well-written
story. The tone is thoroughly healthy; and Mr. Norris, without being in
the least old-fashioned, manages to get along without the aid of pessimism,
psychology, naturalism, or what is known as frank treatment of the relations
between the sexes.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Westminster Gazette.</b>—‘Mr. Norris writes throughout with much
liveliness and force, saying now and then something that is worth remembering.
And he sketches his minor characters with a firm touch.’</p>

his in which the reader finds himself moving in good society, among men

always show good manners and good breeding.... Suffice it to say that the
story is as readable as any we have yet had from the same pen.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘<i>A Victim of Good Luck</i> is one of the brightest

but they are so pleasant in style and equable in tone that we do not usually
lay them down till we have mastered them; <i>A Victim of Good Luck</i> is a
more agreeable novel than most of this author’s.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Westminster Gazette.</b>—‘<i>A Victim of Good Luck</i> is in Mr. Norris’s
best vein, which means that it is urbane, delicate, lively, and flavoured
with a high quality of refined humour. Altogether a most refreshing book,
and we take it as a pleasant reminder that Mr. Norris is still very near
his highwater mark.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Spectator.</b>—‘Mr. Norris displays to the full his general command of
narrative expedients which are at once happily invented and yet quite natural—which
seem to belong to their place in the book, just as a keystone belongs
to its place in the arch.... The brightest and cleverest book which Mr.
Norris has given us since he wrote <i>The Rogue</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—‘Novels which are neither dull, unwholesome,
morbid, nor disagreeable, are so rare in these days, that <i>A Victim of Good
Luck</i> ... ought to find a place in a book-box filled for the most part with
light literature.... We think it will increase the reputation of an already
very popular author.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘<i>A Victim of Good Luck</i>, like others of this author’s
books, depends little on incident and much on the conception and drawing of
character, on clever yet natural conversation, and on the working out, with
masterly ease, of a novel problem of right and inclination.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> FLORA ANNIE STEEL</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Pall Mall Budget.</b>—‘For this week the only novel worth mentioning
is Mrs. Steel’s <i>The Potter’s Thumb</i>. Her admirable <i>From the Five Rivers</i>,
since it dealt with native Indian life, was naturally compared with Mr.
Kipling’s stories. In <i>The Potter’s Thumb</i> the charm which came from the
freshness of them still remains. Almost every character is convincing, and
some of them excellent to a degree.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘This is a brilliant story—a story that fascinates, tingling
with life, steeped in sympathy with all that is best and saddest.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘The impression left upon one after reading
<i>The Potter’s Thumb</i> is that a new literary artist, of very great and unusual
gifts, has arisen.... In short, Mrs. Steel must be congratulated upon having
achieved a very genuine and amply deserved success.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘A clever story which, in many respects, brings
India very near to its readers. The novel is certainly one interesting alike to
the Anglo-Indian and to those untravelled travellers who make their only
voyages in novelists’ romantic company.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘It is a capital story, full of variety and movement, which
brings with great vividness before the reader one of the phases of Anglo-Indian
life. Mrs. Steel writes forcibly and sympathetically, and much of the
charm of the picture which she draws lies in the force with which she brings
out the contrast between the Asiatic and European world. <i>The Potter’s
Thumb</i> is very good reading, with its mingling of the tragedy and comedy
of life. Its evil woman <i>par excellence</i> ... is a finished study.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Westminster Gazette.</b>—‘A very powerful and tragic story. Mrs.
Steel gives us again, but with greater elaboration than before, one of those
strong, vivid, and subtle pictures of Indian life which we have learnt to expect
from her. To a reader who has not been in India her books seem to get
deeper below the native crust, and to have more of the instinct for the Oriental
than almost anything that has been written in this time.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Leeds Mercury.</b>—‘<i>The Potter’s Thumb</i> is a powerful story of the
mystical kind, and one which makes an instant appeal to the imagination of
the reader.... There is an intensity of vision in this story which is as remarkable
as it is rare, and the book, in its vivid and fascinating revelations of
life, and some of its limitations, is at once brilliant and, in the deepest and
therefore least demonstrative sense, impassioned.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘A romance of East and West, in which the
glamour, intrigue, and superstition of India are cunningly interwoven and
artfully contrasted with the bright and changeable aspects of modern European
society. “Love stories,” as Mr. Andrew Lang once observed, “are best done
by women”; and Mrs. Steel’s treatment of Rose Tweedie’s love affair with
Lewis Gordon is a brilliant instance in point. So sane and delightful an
episode is rare in fiction now-a-days.’</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘Time was when these sketches of native Punjabi society
would have been considered a curiosity in literature. They are sufficiently
remarkable, even in these days, when interest in the “dumb millions” of
India is thoroughly alive, and writers, great and small, vie in ministering to it.
They are the more notable as being the work of a woman. Mrs. Steel has
evidently been brought into close contact with the domestic life of all classes,
Hindu and Mahomedan, in city and village, and has steeped herself in their
customs and superstitions.... Mrs. Steel’s book is of exceptional merit
and freshness.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Vanity Fair.</b>—‘Stories of the Punjaub—evidently the work of one who
has an intimate knowledge of, and a kindly sympathy for, its people. It is
to be hoped that this is not the last book of Indian stories that Mrs. Steel
will give us.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Spectator.</b>—‘Merit, graphic force, and excellent local colouring are
conspicuous in Mrs. Steel’s <i>From the Five Rivers</i>, and the short stories of which
the volume is composed are evidently the work of a lady who knows what
she is writing about.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘This is a collection of sketches of Hindu life, full
for the most part of brilliant colouring and cleverly wrought in dialect. The
writer evidently knows her subject, and she writes about it with unusual
skill.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The North British Daily Mail.</b>—‘In at least two of the sketches in Mrs.
Steel’s book we have a thoroughly descriptive delineation of life in Indian, or
rather, Hindoo, villages. “Ganesh Chunel” is little short of a masterpiece,
and the same might be said of “Shah Sujah’s Mouse.” In both we are made
the spectator of the conditions of existence in rural India. The stories are
told with an art that conceals the art of story-telling.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘They possess this great merit, that they reflect the
habits, modes of life, and ideas of the middle and lower classes of the population
of Northern India better than do systematic and more pretentious works.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Leeds Mercury.-</b>-‘By no means a book to neglect.... It is written
with brains.... Mrs. Steel understands the life which she describes, and she
has sufficient literary art to describe it uncommonly well. These short
stories of Indian life are, in fact, quite above the average of stories long or
short.... There is originality, insight, sympathy, and a certain dramatic
instinct in the portrayal of character about the book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘She puts before us the natives of our Empire in the East as
they live and move and speak, with their pitiful superstitions, their strange
fancies, their melancholy ignorance of what poses with us for knowledge and
civilisation, their doubt of the new ways, the new laws, the new people.
“Shah Sujah’s Mouse,” the gem of the collection—a touching tale of
unreasoning fidelity towards an English "Sinny Baba"—is a tiny bit of
perfect writing.’</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> MAXWELL GRAY</div>

    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘<i>The Last Sentence</i> is a remarkable story; it abounds
with dramatic situations, the interest never for a moment flags, and the
characters are well drawn and consistent.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—‘There is a great deal as well as a great variety
of incident in the story, and more than twenty years are apportioned to it; but
it never seems over-crowded, nor has it the appearance of several stories rolled
into one. <i>The Last Sentence</i> is a remarkable novel, and the more so because
its strong situations are produced without recourse to the grosser forms of
immorality.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘One of the most powerful and adroitly-worked-out
plots embodied in any modern work of fiction runs through <i>The Last
Sentence</i>.... This terrible tale of retribution is told with well-sustained force
and picturesqueness, and abounds in light as well as shade.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘Maxwell Gray has the advantage of manner that is
both cultured and picturesque, and while avoiding even the appearance of the
melodramatic, makes coming events cast a shadow before them so as to excite
and entertain expectation.... It required the imagination of an artist to
select the kind of Nemesis which finally overtakes this successful evil-doer, and
which affords an affecting climax to a rather fascinating tale.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘This is a very strong story.... It contains much
rich colouring, some striking situations, and plenty of thoroughly living
characters. The interest is of a varied kind, and, though the hero is an
aristocrat, the pictures of human life are by no means confined to the upper
circles.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Leeds Mercury.</b>—‘It shows a command of the resources of the
novelist’s art which is by no means common, and it has other qualities which
lift it far above the average level of the circulating library. It is written with
a literary grace and a moral insight which are seldom at fault, and from first
to last it is pervaded with deep human interest.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Queen.</b>—‘Maxwell Gray has a certain charm and delicacy of style.
She has mastered the subtleties of a particular type of weak character until
she may be almost called its prophet.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Lady’s Pictorial.</b>—‘The book is a clever and powerful one....
Cynthia Marlowe will live in our memories as a sweet and noble woman; one
of whom it is a pleasure to think of beside some of the ‘emancipated’ heroines
so common in the fiction of the day.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Courier.</b>—‘The author of <i>The Silence of Dean Maitland</i>
gives to the reading world another sound and magnificent work.... In both
these works Maxwell Gray has taken “Nemesis” as his grand <i>motif</i>. In each
work there sits behind the hero that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>atra cura</i></span> which poisons the wholesome
draught of human joy. In each is present the corroding blight that comes
of evil done and not discovered.’</p>

    <div class='c000'>A Tale of West and East</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> RUDYARD KIPLING <span class='fss'>AND</span> WOLCOTT BALESTIER</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s.</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘There is no one but Mr. Kipling who can make his
readers taste and smell, as well as see and hear, the East; and in this book
(if we except the description of Tarvin’s adventures in the deserted city of
Gunvaur, which is perhaps less clear-cut than usual) he has surely surpassed
himself. In his faculty for getting inside the Eastern mind and showing its
queer workings Mr. Kipling stands alone.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘<i>The Naulahka</i> contains passages of great merit.
There are descriptions scattered through its pages which no one but Mr.
Kipling could have written.... Whoever reads this novel will find much of
it hard to forget ... and the story of the exodus from the hospital will rank
among the best passages in modern fiction.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Times.</b>—‘A happy idea, well adapted to utilize the respective experience
of the joint authors.... An excellent story.... The dramatic train
of incident, the climax of which is certainly the interview between Sitabhai
and Tarvin, the alternate crudeness and ferocity of the girl-queen, the
susceptibility of the full-blooded American, hardly kept in subjection by his
alertness and keen eye to business, the anxious eunuch waiting in the distance
with the horses, and fretting as the stars grow paler and paler, the cough of
the tiger slinking home at the dawn after a fruitless night’s hunt—the whole
forms a scene not easily effaced from the memory.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘An entrancing story beyond doubt.... The
design is admirable—to bring into violent contrast and opposition the widely
differing forces of the Old World and the New—and while, of course, it
could have been done without the use of Americanese, yet that gives a
wonderful freshness and realism to the story. The design is a bold one, and
it has been boldly carried out.... The interest is not only sustained throughout,
it is at times breathless.... The Maharajah, the rival queens, the
pomp and peril of Rhatore, are clearly Mr. Kipling’s own, and some of the
Indian chapters are in his best style.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘In the presentation of Rhatore there is something of the
old Kiplingesque glamour; it is to the pages of Mr. Kipling that one must
go for the strange people and incidents of the royal household at Rhatore....
It is enough to say that the plotting of that most beautiful and most
wicked gipsy, Sitabhai is interesting; that Sitabhai is well created; and that
the chapter which describes her secret meeting with Tarvin is probably the
finest and the most impressive in the book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Bookman.</b>—‘The real interest of the book is in the life behind the
curtains of the Maharajah’s palace. The child Kunwar, his mother, the
forsaken Zulu queen, the gipsy with her wicked arts, are pictures of Indian
life, which even Mr. Kipling has not surpassed.’</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘In his first book, <i>Mr. Bailey-Martin</i>, Mr. White gave
us a remarkable picture of the sordidness of life in a suburban household. In
the present volume he rises to a higher social level, and treats of rising members
of Parliament, of political leaders, and even of Prime Ministers.... The
sketches of types are both forcible and true.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘None can travel over his brightly-written
pages without being gladdened by the little flashes of epigram which light up
the scene for us, or stirred by the shrewdness and worldly wisdom which he
has put into the mouths of his characters. One of the charms of the book
lies in the conviction that its author knows the world, and is full of a broad,
full knowledge, and therefore sympathy with the foibles, passions, and sins
with which it abounds.... It is a sermon preached on the old Æschylian
text, that the evil doer must always suffer. The book is a drama of biting
intensity, a tragedy of inflexible purpose and relentless result.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘Will appeal to many tastes. There is intrigue
enough in it for those who love a story of the ordinary kind, and the political
part is perhaps rather more attractive in its sparkle and variety of incident
than the real thing itself.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘<i>Corruption</i> more than fulfils the brilliant promise
of <i>Mr. Bailey-Martin</i>.... As its title indicates, it deals with the political
and social cankers of the day, which it lays bare with a fearless and unerring
touch.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘The scenes in the South of France are particularly well
done; without any attempt at local colour Mr. White has caught the atmosphere
skilfully, and there are one or two clever touches of which he appears
unconscious. Taking the book as a whole, it is written with ease and knowledge,
and has about it nothing of the amateur.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Graphic.</b>—‘A very able piece of work.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘The risqué situation is wrought with brilliance and
subtilty.... Mrs. Mannering recalls Becky Sharp; and Carew is a typical
man of the day.... Mr. Percy White assuredly takes rank with the foremost
of the society writers.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘A graphic picture of social life.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘Mr. White, with the aid of the necessary qualities—dry

is one exceedingly difficult to portray.... Mr. White has resisted the
temptation to force and exaggerate the note, and this is probably the secret of
his success.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘There is cleverness enough in <i>Mr. Bailey-Martin</i> to
furnish forth a dozen novels.... It shows not only a remarkable knowledge
of contemporary life, but a keen insight into character, and a considerable
degree of literary power.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘The book teems with smart sayings and graphic
characterisations, and cannot fail to make a mark among the cleverest novels
of the year.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘The book must be pronounced a well-nigh unqualified
triumph.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘<i>Mr. Bailey-Martin</i> is one of those books whose
opportune arrival serves to reconcile the critic to his task.... Bright, fresh,
vigorous in action, and told with a wealth of incident and humour.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The New Budget</b>, <i>in a criticism on</i> Mr. Percy White <i>as a novelist, says</i>—‘In
my opinion, you are by far the cleverest of the younger—or shall I say,
youngest?—generation of writers, with the exception, perhaps, of Mr. Street....
Your prose possesses in a high degree what I may call the lyrical note.
At times you write like a poet rather than a writer of prose.... You serve
in no school, and imitate no man.... In <i>Mr. Bailey-Martin</i>, though you
write with an affectation of wholly dispassionate observation of your snob and
his set, there is underlying that attitude a measureless contempt for your hero
(if I may call him so) and his friends, which bites like an acid.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘Admirably clever, and deserving to be read by
those who are bored with the average novel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Bookman.</b>—‘One of the cleverest novels we have seen for many a
day.... Take away from the average man a little of his affectation, and all
his responsibilities; add some impudence, and the production of a Bailey-Martin
is highly probable. We congratulate Mr. White on the vigour and
vitality of his novel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘When it is remembered that this story is told by Mr.
Bailey-Martin himself, and with a great air of verisimilitude, it will be seen
how able the book is as a piece of literature.... It will interest and entertain

</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘All the stories are told by a man whose heart and soul are
in his profession of literature.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘The discriminating will not fail to recognise in
the tales composing this volume workmanship of a very high order and a
wealth of imaginative fancy that is, in a measure, a revelation.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘The appearance of <i>Terminations</i> will in no way shake
the general belief in Mr. Henry James’s accomplished touch and command of
material. On the contrary, it confirms conclusions long since foregone, and
will increase the respect of his readers.... With such passages of trenchant
wit and sparkling observation, surely in his best manner, Mr. James ought to
be as satisfied as his readers cannot fail to be.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘Mr. James is a critic of life rather than a maker of
stories; his appeal is more to the intellect than to the imagination. <i>Terminations</i>
is a collection of four stories written with that choiceness and conciseness
of phrase that distinguishes the work of the literary artist.... <i>The Altar of
the Dead</i> is more mystic and imaginative. Mr. James finds phrases that
express incomparably well the more spiritual longings of our nature, and this
story is full of tender suggestiveness.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘What strikes one, in fact, in every corner of
Mr. James’s work is his inordinate cleverness. These four tales are so clever,
that one can only raise one’s hands in admiration. The insight, the sympathy
with character, the extraordinary observation, and the neat and dexterous
phrasing—these qualities are everywhere visible.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘All the stories are peculiar and full of a rare interest.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘... But with <i>The Altar of the Dead</i>
it is far otherwise. To attempt to criticise a creation so exquisite, so instinct
with the finest and purest human feeling, so penetrated with the fastidious
distinction of a sensitive spirit, would indeed be superfluous, if not impertinent.
On its own lines, we know of no more beautiful, truer prose poem in the
English language, and to have written it is to have formulated a claim to
recollection which we do not think will be lightly set aside.’</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘Clever characterisation, natural dialogue,
moral sanity, and keen observation and knowledge of the world.... The
minor characters are as diverse as they are numerous, and there is not a lay
figure in the book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘<i>Herbert Vanlennert</i> is good throughout. The
analysis of the hero’s character is excellent. The story is crowded with minor
characters, all clearly individualised and seen in nice relation to their surroundings.
There is much power of observation, much knowledge of life and
art displayed throughout.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘A piece of life and a work of art.... Mr.
Keary’s men and women are solid all through. He is as honest in his presentation
of life as Mr. Gissing, but he is more pointed and wittier; he is less
witty than Mr. Meredith, but he is more responsible.... Mr. Keary’s work
stands out as a very brilliant piece of honest, knowledgable, wise artistry. We
say it deliberately, that there are very few novels of our time that bear so
unmistakably the grip of the master-hand as <i>Herbert Vanlennert</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘A novel like this helps us at once to understand,
to judge, and to enjoy life; and that is to say that he has written a
novel of the kind that only the great novelists write. From time to time there
comes a new novel marked by a kind and degree of excellence that compels
praise of an emphatic kind. There need be no hesitation about deciding that
<i>Herbert Vanlennert</i> is such a book.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Review of Reviews.</b>—‘In <i>Herbert Vanlennert</i> indeed is a whole
little world of living people—friends and acquaintances whom it is not easy to
forget.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Sketch.</b>—‘Full of cleverness and a legitimate realism. Of two of the
most strongly marked and skilfully drawn characters, one is Maynard, the
artist of genius; the other, a striking contrast to Maynard, is Bernard, who
passes a serene existence in the study of metaphysics. Very charming and
interesting are Mr. Keary’s bright and vivid descriptions of English country
life and scenery in Derbyshire.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>St. Paul’s.</b>—‘The book contains much clever writing, and is in many
respects a strong one.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘There is abundance of skilfully drawn characters
and brilliantly sketched incidents, which, once read, cannot be forgotten.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘Mr. Keary, even when he is treading on delicate
ground, writes with circumspection and cleverness.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Bradford Observer.</b>—‘It is a fine piece of art, and should touch its
readers to fine issues.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Courier.</b>—‘The book is most interesting, and embodies
a great deal of careful work, besides some very plain speaking.’</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘The novel is marked by great strength, which
is always under subjection to the author’s gift of restraint, so that we are made
to feel the intensity all the more. Pathos and humour (in the true sense) go
together through these chapters; and for such qualities as earnestness, insight,
moral courage, and thoughtfulness, <i>The Years that the Locust hath Eaten</i>
stands out prominently among noteworthy books of the time.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘Bears out to the full the promise given by <i>Joanna
Traill, Spinster</i>. The author has a genuine sense of humour and an eye for
character, and if she bids us weep at the tragedy of life and death, she makes
us smile by her pleasant handling of human foible and eccentricities.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘A worthy successor to <i>Joanna Traill, Spinster</i>. It is
quite as powerful. It has insight and sympathy and pathos, humour, and
some shrewd understanding of human nature scattered up and down its pages.
Moreover, there is beauty in the story and idealism.... Told with a humour,
a grace, a simplicity, that ought to give the story a long reign.... The
charm of the book is undeniable; it is one that only a clever woman, full of
the best instincts of her sex, could have written.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Review of Reviews.</b>—‘It has all the charm and simplicity of treatment
which gave its predecessor (<i>Joanna Traill, Spinster</i>) its vogue.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘The book should not be missed by a fastidious
novel-reader.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Court Journal.</b>—‘The moral of the book is excellent; the style
strong and bold.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘The story is well told, and a vein of humour serves to
bring the pathos into higher relief.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘It is sincere and conscientious, and it
shows appreciation of the value of reticence.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Courier.</b>—‘The book is full of delicate touches of
characterisation, and is written with considerable sense of style.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘Worked out with great skill and success....
The story is powerfully told.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Liverpool Mercury.</b>—‘The story is told with sympathy and pathos,
and the concluding chapters are touching in the extreme.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Birmingham Gazette.</b>—‘A sad story beautifully written, containing
pure thoughts and abundant food for reflection upon the misery which exists in
the world at the present day. The tale is particularly pathetic, but it is true
in character. It will be read with interest.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Leeds Mercury.</b>—‘Full of powerful situations.’</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘Mrs. Lynn Linton commands the respect of her readers
and critics. Her new story, <i>In Haste and at Leisure</i>, is as powerful a piece
of writing as any that we owe to her pen.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Budget.</b>—‘A thorough mistress of English, Mrs. Lynn
Linton uses the weapons of knowledge and ridicule, of sarcasm and logic, with
powerful effect; the shallow pretences of the “New Woman” are ruthlessly
torn aside.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘Whatever its exaggerations may be, <i>In Haste and
at Leisure</i> remains a notable achievement. It has given us pleasure, and we
can recommend it with confidence.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Court Journal.</b>—‘The book is a long but brilliant homily and series
of object-lessons against the folly and immorality of the modern craze of the
most advanced women, who rail against men, marriage, and maternity. The
book is immensely powerful, and intensely interesting.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Graphic.</b>—‘It is an interesting story, while it is the most
tremendous all-round cannonade to which the fair emancipated have been
subjected.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘It is clever, and well written.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Graphic.</b>—‘It is thoroughly interesting, and it is full of passages that
almost irresistibly tempt quotation.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘It is a novel that ought to be, and will be,
widely read and enjoyed.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘It is impossible not to recognise and acknowledge its great

succeeded.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘There are good things in this novel; excellent character-drawing,
some forcibly realistic chapters in the life of a common soldier.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘The story is skilfully constructed, and will certainly
add to Miss Robinson’s reputation.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘Miss Robinson writes but little, and writes that
little carefully.... Herein also is Miss Robinson true to life, and not false
to art.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Realm.</b>—‘The story is powerfully written. It is worth reading.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘All the vicissitudes of Treganna’s career are interesting,
and are vividly told.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Lady.</b>—‘A story of exceptional power and absorbing interest, earnest,
forcible, intensely human, and of high literary merit.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Observer.</b>—‘The book is very ably written, and it is well worth
reading.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘There are in this book much power of observation, a relentless
truthfulness, and a recognition of the value of detail. It should enchain
the attention of the most callous reader.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Sunday Times.</b>—‘A remarkably clever sketch of a man’s life and
character.... The literary workmanship is good without being laboured....
We wish it the appreciation, not only of those who can distinguish good
literature, but of those who prefer the good from the bad.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘An original plot vigorously treated.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Graphic.</b>—‘The whole story of the relations between Joseph
Treganna and Fanny Star is very human, and handled with a breadth and
understanding which very few women novelists of the day could hope to rival,
while the gradual abandonment by the man of the outposts whereon he has
planted his colours is admirable in its inevitableness.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Woman.</b>—‘A superb novel, strong and full of life, packed with observation
and humour of the deep subcutaneous sort.’</p>

and snobbishness of society.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘No one who reads <i>The Story of a Modern Woman</i> will
be likely to gainsay the excellence of its writing, and the genuine talent shown
by Miss Dixon.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘A subtle study, written by a woman, about a
woman, and from the point of view of a distinctly clever and modern woman
herself.... Miss Dixon has scored a great success in the treatment of her
novel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Vanity Fair.</b>—‘The main thread of the story is powerful and pathetic; but
there are lighter touches, wit and humour, and here and there what seem like
shadows of people we have seen and known.... In a word, a book to buy,
to read, and to enjoy.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘The social sketches, with which this little story of
modern, literary, fashionable, and Bohemian London is full, are very cleverly
touched in.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Graphic.</b>—‘Miss Ella Hepworth Dixon has inherited no small share
of her father’s literary gifts, and she adds to it a faculty of observation, and a
constructive and narrative skill, which are of considerable promise.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘She writes well, and shows not a little power
of drawing character, and even of constructing a story.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Sketch.</b>—‘Miss Dixon’s style excels in delicate vignettes, full of
suggestion, and marked, above all, by that artistic restraint which is such an
agreeable contrast to the fluency of the average woman-novel.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>St. James’s Gazette.</b>—‘Miss Hepworth Dixon knows how to write....
She can say what she wants to say in a sound, clear style, which (especially

Altogether, <i>A Modern Woman</i> is a work which will better repay reading than
most of the novels of the season.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Illustrated London News.</b>—‘A story of which so much can truthfully be
said is a contribution to art as well as to the circulating library, a conjunction

<p class='c015'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘The characters are exceptionally distinct, the movement

and it has given us pleasure to follow her spicy, attractive personality through
all the phases of her carefully, finely-depicted evolution.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘A remarkably life-like picture of English
society. The author is a keen observer. The writing is above the average.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘An excellent novel. Joanna Conway is one of
the most attractive figures in recent fiction. It is no small tribute to the
author’s skill that this simple country girl, without beauty or accomplishments,
is from first to last so winning a personality. The book is full of excellent
observation.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘Some pleasant hours may be passed in following the
fortunes of Joanna, the charming heroine of M. Hamilton’s <i>A Self-Denying
Ordinance</i>. The book is well written, and holds the attention from start to
finish. The characters are true to life.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Methodist Times.</b>—‘The story retains its interest throughout. It

England has had from a new writer for years and years past.’</p>

sketch of life in its different phases.... “Every personage strikes one as
being richly endowed with individuality.”’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Courier.</b>—‘A decided success. There are such women
as Joanna Conway in the world, though, unfortunately, not so many as are
required; but there are few writers of the present day who can do justice to
such a character, so poetical, and yet so practical.... There is humour in
the book: the scene is chiefly in Ireland, and who can truly write of Ireland
without humour? but the greatest charm is in the wonderful tenderness, in
the womanly chivalry which renders so true the title of a self-denying
ordinance.’</p>

constructed.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Academy.</b>—‘Page after page glows with masterly invention, tender
pathos, excellent wit: attributes belonging to the magicians of fiction. Its
cleverness is often near akin to absolute genius; the dexterity of the writer
evokes not only surprises, but rare pleasure.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘The characters are clearly defined and combined
with great skill; they breathe genuineness and truth. There is force
and pathos, too, in the story of Bancroft and Loo Conklin.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Review of Reviews.</b>—‘There is a force and a charm, a vividness
and an originality about these tales which give them a high, if not the highest,
place in the literature of that kind which has been produced in the last few
years, Not only is there a genius in the presentation of the human types
which are described, but they display a closeness of observation and a keenness
of insight into the heart of things which only those who have studied western
civilisation in the making can appreciate.’</p>

like life. And they live with one after, as living realities.’</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘In a sense this novel is belated, being a straggler from the
procession of books more or less directly concerned with the New Woman.
This is a pity, for it is perhaps the best of the novels that have vindicated or
mocked at that tiresome female.... Still it may be allowed that here we
meet with less cant, less rancour, less prurience, less affectation of omniscience,
more genuine philosophy, and a more careful style and more real literary
power than in any other novel of the same school.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Athenæum.</b>—‘The character-drawing is distinctly good. All the
personages stand out well defined with strongly marked individualities.’</p>

author’s pictures of Bohemian life are bright and graphic.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘The merit of the book lies in the description
of the life of Clytie Davenant (the heroine) as an artist in London, of her
friendship with Kent, her wooing by Thornton Hammerdyke, and the struggles
of her married life. All this is portrayed, not in the grand style, but soberly,
truthfully, and on the whole effectively.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘This clever and somewhat audacious story....
We congratulate W. J. Locke, and shall be surprised if the reception accorded
this book is not such as to cause him to congratulate himself.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Review of Reviews.</b>—‘Here is a tale of women’s life in London in the
present year, of varied societies, of a husband’s brutality, and of a woman’s
fidelity, told with restraint, power, and originality. It is certainly one of the
novels which mark a beginner out for attention.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Vanity Fair.</b>—‘After long course of flaccid, nerveless books that seem
to have no <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span>, it is refreshing to find a well-written novel whose
characters seem “hewn from life,” and act as men and women really act.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘The story never drags and can be read from end to
end. It seems to be a first work, and in its strength and vigour gives good
promise for the future. The workmanship is careful and conscientious, while
the characterisation is broad, human, and natural.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘In depicting the friendship between
Clytie and Kent the author shows both power and subtlety, and may fairly
claim to have given us something new, for the portrayal of such a relationship
between a man and a woman standing on an equal intellectual level has not
been successfully attempted before.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Graphic.</b>—‘The story embodies a study of remarkable subtlety and
power, and the style is not only vivid and picturesque, but in those passages
of mixed emotion and reflection, which strike what is, perhaps, the characteristic
note of late nineteenth century prose literature, is touched with something
of a poetic charm.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Standard.</b>—‘The setting of the book is vivid, and the effect of silence

it with an interest that does not suffer him to consider its absurdity.’</p>

it is written with a distinction which gives Mr. Hichens a conspicuous place

It is marked out with an imaginative resource which has a welcome note
of literature.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Graphic.</b>—‘A profoundly impressive study in psychology.

indeed, Mr. Hichens has a rare power of stimulating the reader’s imagination
until it fills in what no one can write, and thus helps to create a vivid picture.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘It is no doubt a remarkable book. If it has almost
none of the humour of its predecessor (<i>The Green Carnation</i>), it is written
with the same brilliancy of style, and the same skill is shown in the drawing
of accessories. Mr. Hichens’s three characters never fail to be interesting.
They are presented with very considerable power, while the background of
Egyptian life and scenery is drawn with a sure hand.’</p>

<p class='c015'><b>The Spectator.</b>—‘Several of his types are painted in with a fine combination
of breadth of effect and wealth of significant detail.... Certainly a book
which has not merely cleverness, but real vitality.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Speaker.</b>—‘A novel of such remarkable merit, and written with such
easy mastery of style. From first to last this striking and powerful story
maintains a high level of excellence, betokening no ’prentice hand. It is a
story teeming with humour and pathos, instinct with the irony of human fate,
and quick to apprehend the subtle twists and inconsistencies of human
character. Above all, it is deliciously original ... and told with great spirit,
humour, and dramatic vigour. A vivid picture of a side of life upon which
little light has been cast by our novelists since Dickens laid down his pen.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Morning Post.</b>—‘On the whole realistic; this presentment of
Holland in London has certain impressionist touches that are decidedly
effective.... All the tragedy of the book centres in the figure of Peter van
Eijk, a creation which says much for the author’s imaginative powers.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Telegraph.</b>—‘A singular little novel, which has so undeniable
a power of its own.’ (Mr. <span class='sc'>W. L. Courtney</span>.)</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘The literary treatment is fresh and impressive.... The
author shows skill in all its characterisations, his mastery of Dutch idiosyncrasy
being obviously complete.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘One does not care to put the book down till the
last page is turned.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Westminster Gazette.</b>—‘Vivid in portraiture, vivacious in manner....  The
combination of close observation and grim sardonic humour gives
the book a decided charm....The pathetic figure of Peter is drawn with a
tenderness which indefinitely enlarges our impression of the author’s dramatic
possibilities.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Weekly Sun.</b>—‘Has the great merit of introducing us to a new
world.... What a delightful creation Mrs. de Griendt is. Indeed, I should
personally have been glad if we had had more of her. Whenever she appears
on the stage she fills it with her presence, and you can see her, hear her, watch
her with fascination and incessant interest.... I think the reader will agree
with me that I have not exaggerated the literary merit of this exquisitely-described
scene.’ (<span class='sc'>T. P. O’Connor</span>, M.P.)</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Review of Reviews.</b>—‘You will enjoy reading it.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Glasgow Herald.</b>—‘A striking and amusing novel.... The author
has a pleasant gift of humour, and has shown distinct originality.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Aberdeen Daily Free Press.</b>—‘In the publication of this and
kindred works, Mr. Heinemann is doing much to maintain the freshness and
vigour of our English fiction....He has seldom provided a pleasanter and
yet more bracing work than the <i>Drama</i> now before us.... As a mere story
it will carry delight to even the most unthinking.’</p>

    <div><span class='large'>MISS GRACE OF ALL SOULS’</span></div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='sc'>By</span> W. E. TIREBUCK</div>
    <div class='c000'><span class='small'><i>In One Volume, price 6s</i>.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'><b>The Times.</b>—‘Since Mrs. Gaskell wrote her <i>Mary Barton</i> we have seen
no more interesting novel on the condition of the working classes. Mr,
Tirebuck is thoroughly master of his subject.... A vivid and impressive
narrative of the great coal strike of a couple of years ago.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b> —‘Every reader anxious to hear of a work that is full
of brains and vigour may unhesitatingly enter <i>Miss Grace of All Souls’</i> upon
his list of books worthy to be perused.... Mr. Tirebuck, not content with
providing “Grace” for our admiration, has made another claim upon our love
by presenting us to Nance Ockleshaw. For her sake alone <i>Miss Grace of All
Souls’</i> should be read, and we hope that the novel will make its way into many
a home, there to be considered with all the care that is due to it.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘The most remarkable contribution made by fiction to the
history of the working classes since <i>Mary Barton</i>, and it has a wider range
and import of deeper gravity. It appeals directly to the thoughtful among
readers, those who care to learn, on the object-lesson plan, the facts and
aspects of life among the multitudes, with whom they are brought into actual
contact. The girl who is its central figure is an original and very attractive
character.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘An uncommonly well-told story, interesting from
first to last. Mr. Tirebuck has drawn a truly delightful character in the
miner’s wife; indeed, the whole family might well have been sketched straight
from the life. It is difficult to make a work of fiction at once instructive and
entertaining, but Mr. Tirebuck has done it in <i>Miss Grace of All Souls’</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Pall Mall Gazette.</b>—‘An admirable piece of work. Here is realism
in its proper proportions: the rude, harsh, Methody life of the northern miner
engraved in all its essentials. Mr. Tirebuck manages to illustrate the conditions
of miners’ lives for us with complete fidelity. Not a touch of the
humour, the pathos, the tragedy, the grime, the sin, and the ideals is lacking....
Mr. Tirebuck has done his work to perfection. The story is not a moral
tract, but a work of art of great significance.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The British Weekly.</b>—‘Mr. Tirebuck is a practised and powerful novelist,
and in this story he has taken us right inside the heart of the poor. His
description of the collier’s wife is wonderful work.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Guardian.</b>—‘As a picture of working men and women,
instinct as it is with knowledge, sympathy, passion, and conviction, we have
seldom, if ever, read anything so good.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Manchester Courier.</b>—‘The character of Miss Grace reminds the
reader of the heroine of Charles Kingsley’s <i>Westward Ho</i>.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Saturday Review.</b>—‘A finely conceived study. The book is true
without being sordid—realistic in the better meaning of the word; and we
have read it with the greatest interest and some stirrings of emotion.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The National Observer.</b>—‘The strong and true spirit of the husband
gives an ennobling study of humanity worth many plots. Miss Sergeant has
risen to her earlier level in this book, a fine study of character, and it is only
just to say that it is also strong in detail.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The World.</b>—‘A work to which the much-used adjective “beautiful”
may be applied with full intention and strict justice.‘</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily Chronicle.</b>—‘Miss Sergeant has given her best matter, treated
in her best manner.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Daily News.</b>—‘A moving story. In the delineation of the softening
of the man’s spirit, and of the mental struggles by which he reaches to forgiveness
of his wife, Miss Sergeant shows a fine imagination. This is the best
book of Miss Sergeant’s that has come under our notice for some time.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Globe.</b>—‘Miss Sergeant follows her hero with a rare grasp of descriptive
detail. The concluding chapters of the book reach a high level of pathos,
dignity, and convincing humanity.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Black and White.</b>—‘Gideon Blake is a fine creation and the record of
his devotion to the unworthy Emmy, an his attempted expiation of her sins,
is forcibly wrought. The closing tragedy, simply treated, is impressive.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Literary World.</b>—‘The story is well put together, and has points of
more than passing interest and importance.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>The Scotsman.</b>—‘It is in the development of the great theme of a man’s
undying constancy to his erring partner, and his eventual forgiveness of her
offence, that the author rises to a height of true dramatic power seldom attained
in the modern novel. On its merits the story is worthy of a high place in
contemporary fiction.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Birmingham Daily Post.</b>—‘The character of Gideon Blake, the intense
and strong-minded husband of the fragile Emmy, is a fine creation, based on
the harder types of moral grandeur.’</p>

<p class='c001'><b>Bradford Observer.</b>—‘The tale is sincerely and touchingly written. Its
characters are veritable flesh and blood.’</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
